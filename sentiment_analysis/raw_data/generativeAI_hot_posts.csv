3,1701501030.0,It is time to hop onto the most anticipated Generative AI tool in 2024 - A single link reproduces the entire website and its summary,"Chat GPT has undoubtedly become one of the best methods for summarizing long texts into shorter, quick-read paragraphs. However, this still requires copying and pasting the 'long texts' which in most cases, can be difficult for websites that are produced to be READ-ONLY. 

Now, with Clemory, it has become possible to simply copy and paste the link of a website to generate a summary as well as a documented version of the original texts itself. 

This is how Clemory does it: 

1. Clemory scans the website of the link you insert in less than 4 seconds. 
2. It draws out the real essence of the content - no ads, no pop-ups.
3. Regardless of how long the website is, Clemory generates a summary of it in one paragraph. 
4. Below the summary, Clemory pastes the original texts in the website which are of course editable, annotatable and exportable. 

It is time to hop onto the most anticipated Generative AI tool in 2024.

6,1701369543.0,How can GPT model perform Big integer calculations without actually being trained on it?,"I'm a programmer and have a general understanding how Neural Networks work and how they're trained.

I asked ChatGPT (3.5 and 4) a simple computational question assuming that the model wasn't trained on that exact sample. (I even doubt it can be ptentially trained on any BigInt computations technically because of near infinite input space) Am I wrong?

The question:

>Find greatest common divider of 12313669214 and 24689801381.

GPT3.5 answer (reduced):

>Let's find the GCD of 12313669214 and 24689801381 using the Euclidean algorithm:  
>  
>Step 1. Divide 24689801381 by 12313669214. 24689801381÷12313669214=2 with a remainder of 68  
>  
>Step 2. Now, replace the larger number with the smaller number and the remainder:12313669214÷68=181041017 with a remainder of 10  
>  
>Step 3. Next iteration:68÷10=6 with a remainder of 8  
>  
>Step 4. Another iteration:10÷8=1 with a remainder of 2  
>  
>Step 5. Final iteration:8÷2=4 with a remainder of 0​  
>  
>Since the remainder became zero, the last non-zero remainder before it  became zero was 2. Therefore, the greatest common divisor (GCD) of  12313669214 and 24689801381 is 2.

GPT4 answer:

>Sure, let’s calculate the greatest common divisor (GCD) of 12313669214 and 24689801381 using the Euclidean method.  
>  
>The Euclidean method works by dividing the larger number by the smaller number and then using the remainder of this operation as the new smaller number. This process is repeated until the remainder is zero, at which point the smaller number is the GCD.  
>  
>Here’s how it works:  
>  
>Divide 24689801381 by 12313669214 to get a quotient of 2 and a remainder of 62462953.  
>  
>Now, divide 12313669214 by 62462953 to get a quotient of 197 and a remainder of 0.  
>  
>So, the greatest common divisor of 12313669214 and 24689801381 is **62462953**.

Both are incorrect, the answer should be 122717.

From the answers above I can see that it often makes mistakes in the remainder computation. However only once it was able to ""calculate"" the remainder correctly, see

>Divide 24689801381 by 12313669214 to get a quotient of 2 and a remainder of 62462953

I was surprised because NNs are just a prediction models and can't predict/approximate a computation result if the training samples didn't have it. I doubt OpenAI/Microsoft has trained their models with such specific remainders computation because of 1) near infinite input space 2) approximation may not work with this kind of numbers

Where am i mistaken? Can someone explain how the GPT model was able to predict the remainder result? Is it just a coincidence? Or maybe it has a scientific calculator hidden in some layer of NN? :)",neleus5,1,0.67,4,https://www.reddit.com/r/generativeAI/comments/187pnrs/how_can_gpt_model_perform_big_integer/

Hi guys! 👋

I'm the cofounder of a tech startup focused on providing free AI services, we're once of the first mobile all-in-one multipurpose AI apps.

We've developed a pretty cool app that offers AI services like image generation, code generation, text generation, story generation, image captioning, and more bundled up through a single interface. We’re working on supporting many models and generative services, but so far we have support for GPT-4, Stable diffusion, Microsoft Azure, with long term plans for Claude, dallE, and music/video generative models . We're the Swiss Army knife of generative and analytical AI.

We'd love to have people try the app out, right now we have around 13,000 downloads and we'd like to expand our user base, get feedback, and keep in touch with all of you. We are INCREDIBLY responsive to user feedback at this stage, so recommend to us anything you'd like to see in the future.

I'm the cofounder of a tech startup focused on providing free AI services, we're once of the first mobile all-in-one multipurpose AI apps.

We've developed a pretty cool app that offers AI services like image generation, code generation, text generation, story generation, image captioning, and more bundled up through a single interface. We’re working on supporting many models and generative services, but so far we have support for GPT-4, Stable diffusion, Microsoft Azure, with long term plans for Claude, dallE, and music/video generative models . We're the Swiss Army knife of generative and analytical AI.

We'd love to have people try the app out, right now we have around 13,000 downloads and we'd like to expand our user base, get feedback, and keep in touch with all of you. We are INCREDIBLY responsive to user feedback at this stage, so recommend to us anything you'd like to see in the future.

These systems use deep learning techniques, such as neural networks, to understand and mimic patterns and structures in data, allowing them to produce new, original content based on the patterns they've learned.  I got some articles on Generative AI technology and you may check this on **WeblineIndia**. 

Generative AI technology is a transformative technology with the potential to improve various aspects of our lives, from enhancing creativity to solving complex global challenges. However, it also brings ethical and societal considerations, such as concerns about privacy, bias, and the impact on employment. As we continue to integrate generative AI into our daily lives, it will be essential to address these issues while maximizing the benefits it offers.

I started to study LLM. There are a couple of things I still don't understand.

It would be great to get some help from the community.

&#x200B;

What I understood:

* Input of datasets is embedded (tokenization) and computed into weights (different values such as self-attention, positional encoding, etc.). This happens on a set of distributed GPUs.
* The more relevant and high quality of the datasets the more relevant the weights are for specific use cases (customer support, manufacturing, etc.).
* We have no details of datasets that trained the public models (chatGPT 4, Falcon, LLAMA 2, etc.)

Correct me if my understanding is mistaken.

&#x200B;

What I don't understand:

* What happens exactly when we input a prompt? (the prompt will be tokenized and matched with the LLM tokens and weights?)
* When we give feedback to the LLMs (RLHF), will that change some of their weights to the better (more relevant)?
* When we do fine-tuning, do we just add new tokens and calculate new weights? Or we change some of the existing weights?
* When we fine-tune a closed model like ChatGPT, the new weights are calculated thanks to private data, are they also available to others?

In the fast-paced realm of marketing, innovation is the name of the game. As we witness technology's continuous evolution, so does the marketing landscape. Enter Generative Artificial Intelligence (Generative AI), a game-changing tool that is rapidly captivating the imagination of marketers, redefining how businesses engage with their audiences. In this post, let's dive into the immense potential of Generative AI in marketing and how it's revolutionizing the industry.

**The Era of Creative Reinvention with Generative AI**

Generative AI, powered by cutting-edge models like GPT-3, is gaining widespread acclaim for its ability to comprehend and create human-like text, images, and more. It's akin to having an AI collaborator that learns from extensive datasets and patterns, making it an adaptable partner for marketers. In the marketing landscape, Generative AI is emerging as a creative powerhouse with the potential to transform campaigns and strategies.

**Personalized Content that Drives Engagement**

One of the most thrilling aspects of Generative AI in marketing is its capacity to craft personalized content. By analyzing user data and behaviours, it excels in generating tailored marketing messages, product recommendations, and even complete ad campaigns. This level of personalization supercharges customer engagement and fuels conversions, as customers respond more favourably to content that aligns with their unique needs and preferences.

**Effortless Content Production**

Content creation has long been a challenge for marketers. With Generative AI, the burden becomes a breeze. It can automate the creation of blog posts, social media updates, product descriptions, and more. This not only saves valuable time and resources but also ensures a steady flow of fresh, top-quality content. Marketers can refocus their efforts on strategy and creativity, knowing that Generative AI has their back.

**Optimizing Campaign Performance**

Testing and refining marketing campaigns are the keystones of success. Generative AI steps in by generating multiple variations of ad copy, headlines, and designs. These variations serve as powerful tools for A/B testing, enabling marketers to pinpoint what resonates most with their target audience. The result? Sharper, more effective campaigns and a superior return on investment.

**Elevating Customer Care**

Exceptional customer support is integral to marketing. Generative AI-powered chatbots are stealing the limelight by engaging with customers in natural language, offering solutions, and answering queries around the clock. This not only enhances the customer experience but also frees up human agents to tackle complex issues and build deeper connections.

**Predicting Tomorrow, Today**

Generative AI excels at analyzing vast datasets to predict customer behaviour and market trends. It delivers insights into which products or services are likely to be in demand, enabling marketers to make informed decisions about strategies and offerings. This predictive edge can give businesses a significant competitive advantage in a constantly evolving landscape.

**Fostering Creativity and Innovation**

Generative AI isn't just a tool; it's a wellspring of creativity and innovation in marketing. It serves as a creative collaborator, assisting in brainstorming fresh campaign ideas, generating creative copy, and even offering design suggestions. Marketers can harness the power of Generative AI to fuel their creative processes and conjure captivating campaigns.

In Conclusion, Generative AI is poised to revolutionize the marketing industry by unlocking unprecedented creativity, personalization, and efficiency. As it continues to evolve and become more accessible, businesses that embrace this technology will be better equipped to navigate the ever-changing marketing landscape and deliver exceptional customer experiences. By leveraging Generative AI, marketers can streamline their processes and unlock new levels of engagement and growth. It's an exciting era for marketing, where the possibilities are boundless, thanks to the magic of Generative AI.

253,1694099170.0,Socializing AI with community: A Live Experiment,"In an exciting exploration of the capabilities of our community AI, I recently embarked on an experiment that took us to a bustling local bar. The objective was to test various facets of our AI system, from its ability to parse multiple conversations in a noisy environment to its agility in switching interview styles based on the roles of the participants. As the evening unfolded, our AI demonstrated remarkable adaptability, leaving me both surprised and delighted.  


What unfolded over the course of the evening exceeded our expectations. Our AI seamlessly immersed itself in the vibrant atmosphere of the bar, engaging in conversations with various patrons about the upcoming community event, the Urban Regatta.  


One of the most impressive aspects of our AI's performance was its ability to adapt to different interviewee roles. As conversations flowed, it adeptly shifted between styles and questions, tailoring its approach to each participant. This dynamic adaptability was especially crucial in maintaining engaging and contextually relevant interactions.  


This success fuels our enthusiasm to move forward with our community AI project. The potential applications are abundant, from enhancing event coverage to strengthening community bonds. We are excited about the possibilities and committed to further refining our AI to continue bridging the gap between technology and community engagement.

It adds extra information and options to your searches using generative AI. 

This applies to shopping, information, and news searches. Users are prompted to try AI for more info, and follow-up questions are provided. Another feature offers summarized responses from top content, potentially bypassing actual content sources. Content augmentation displays related queries or info while users are on a webpage. 

Businesses must adapt to these changes in online marketing. Although unsettling, it presents an opportunity for innovation.

Some of the problems we face:

1. Non textual content - tables and images in pdfs : ensuring this information is extracted correctly capturing the full context.

Are there models/parsers that could tell us the confidence of its extraction results. For example, if 30% of the document is un-extractable (due to tables with complex nested structure or graphs etc), could we know that information somehow.

*The idea is that we could monitor this metric and augment this with manual information as part of our data preprocessing/governance workflow*

1. Chunking strategy - How do models handle ambiguous texts while parsing/embedding. I would rather prefer to highlight texts which are too complex for the models to completely process so I can build my governance around it.

Imagine an expansion pack of the game but that revolves around them and their lives.

For those of you that don't know Dixit, it's a boardgame where several surreal illustration cards are used, and where participants come up with crazy description of these cards that others have to guess in turns. More info here: https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dixit_(card_game)

So, what I'd ideally would like to happen is to spend a few hours with a generative AI tool that can generate about 100 crazy dream like images. Ideally I could 'feed' this tool some pictures of their faces so that they can feature in the illustrations, or at times even just ask the AI to convert a picture into an illustration directly.

Do you think this is possible? Do you have a tool that is better than others for this to recommend? And finally, is there any tool that is better in terms of privacy? I don't feel so great about basically donating plenty of my friends facial data to some shady AI modelsfor this 😅

Hi, all! 

I’m the cofounder of a multipurpose, all-in-one AI app to generate text, images, code, stories, poems, and to analyze image and text, and much more. Sort of like the Swiss Army knife of AI.

It can generate poems, short stories, code, essays, math, and more via GPT4! In addition, it can generate art via stable diffusion v2. On a smaller scale, we have analytical tools that provides text extraction, and a small social environment.

We’re looking for feedback on the functionality, design, and user experience of the app. Check it out below and give me your thoughts:

That made me think about Gen-2 and the many other text to video AI generative tools and how, today, with AI, you can't really create good lip sync in your generative AI videos (therefore, you can't really have dialog unless you make it more of a VO).

So are the current limitations of AI making us use the full potential of the cinematic experience by making us focus on the imagery and having that tell our stories?

Like I want to be able to ask it (in english), ""what is the first time we see XXX happen?"" or ""How frequently does XXX look like YYY""?

I'm happy to use paid tools and APIs where it make sense, but I also need to keep our data private (can't add it somewhere that would them become part of a publicly available model, or something).

Anyone have advice on where to start to build something like this?  I'm interested in product recommendations, general approaches (e.g. get the data into a vector database, hook it up to chatGPT via XXX), or articles/books worth reading that will help me understand the approach.

421,1687085549.0,Some advertisers are requiring their agencies to disclose when they use generative AI,"Advertisers are becoming more cautious about their use of generative AI in advertising, seeking clear disclosure of its application and addressing potential challenges, such as bias and copyright infringement.

**Revising Contracts**: Some large advertisers have begun to modify their contracts with advertising agencies to ensure the agencies are transparent about their use of generative artificial intelligence (AI) in their advertising efforts. This shift in policy is a response to both the increasing use of AI and the potential issues it could present.

* A marketing consultant estimates 10-20% of clients are adding clauses to their contracts that address AI usage.
* This trend reflects a balance between encouraging innovative approaches and recognizing their potential limitations and challenges.

**Concerns about Generative AI in Advertising**: The adoption of generative AI tools in advertising has been rapid, but it's not without its drawbacks. These tools can generate a wide array of ad variations, streamline media plans, and automate tasks such as search engine optimization. However, there are significant concerns regarding bias, data protection, and copyright infringement.

* Some advertising agencies have had to issue warnings about using generative AI tools in client work.
* Certain agencies are advocating for the open disclosure of generative AI usage, especially in influencer campaigns.
* Generative AI can sometimes produce derivative content, which can lead to copyright issues.

**Regulating AI Use through Contracts**: The Association of National Advertisers and the law firm Reed Smith recently updated a media-buying contract template to include a section requiring agencies to seek advertiser permission before using AI. This move reflects a growing interest in setting clear boundaries and expectations around AI usage.

* The template is not mandatory, but it has sparked a lot of interest and inquiries about the implications of the growing use of AI in advertising.
* Advertisers are being encouraged to have open discussions with their agencies about AI usage.

**Advertisers' Approach to AI**: Many marketers are in the early stages of creating agreements with their agencies about how generative AI can be applied. Companies like L'Oréal have even created their own frameworks to guide their use of AI, emphasizing responsible and trustworthy use of the technology.

* Marketers largely do not see AI as a threat to their advertising agencies.
* Companies are in active discussions with their agencies about how to best use generative AI tools, while also setting clear boundaries.
* Some companies are primarily using AI for content optimization, but not for major advertising campaigns.

In conclusion, advertisers are increasingly recognizing the potential and challenges of generative AI. They're making moves to ensure its responsible use by revising contracts and developing internal guidelines, all while maintaining active dialogues with their agencies about how to best leverage this technology.

435,1686378623.0,Automate any task with a single AI command (Open Source)," Hi everyone!

In the LLM Community, there is a growing trend of utilizing high-powered models like GPT-4 for building platforms that tackle complex tasks. However, this approach is neither cost-effective nor feasible for many open-source community developers due to the associated expenses and privacy concerns. In response, Nuggt emerges as an open-source project aiming to provide a platform for deploying agents to solve intricate tasks while relying on smaller and less resource-intensive LLMs. We strive to make task automation accessible, affordable, and secure for all developers in the community!

&#x200B;

https://reddit.com/link/145slh8/video/kh9y97bfx45b1/player

While our current implementation leverages the power of GPT-3.5 (already a huge reduction from the GPT-4 alternative), we recognize the need for cost-effective solutions without compromising functionality. Our ongoing efforts involve exploring and harnessing the potential of smaller models like Vicuna 13B, ensuring that task automation remains accessible to a wider audience.

Due to the development in text-to-image as well 3D modeling technologies (like NeRF), text-to-3D has become a newly emerging yet highly active research field. Our work conducts the first yet comprehensive survey on text-to-3D to help readers interested in this direction quickly catch up with its fast development. First, we introduce 3D data representations, including both Euclidean data and non-Euclidean data. On top of that, we introduce various foundation technologies as well as summarize how recent works combine those foundation technologies to realize satisfactory text-to-3D. Moreover, we summarize how text-to-3D technology is used in various applications, including avatar generation, texture generation, shape transformation, and scene generation.

First, I have two podcasts:

 * [Emoji Puzzles: Daily Emoji Trivia](https://www.buzzsprout.com/2185630/share)
 * [Crowdcast](https://www.buzzsprout.com/2188164/share)

Emoji puzzles was an experimental audio version of my book: http://emojipuzzlebook.com

And Crowdcast is an experimental interactive podcast, crowdsourced weekly from the /r/Crowdcast subreddit.

I made Emoji Puzzles using https://www.wondercraft.ai, which is pretty great, you can hear the quality.

But I made Crowdcast by writing my own python project, basically emulating what Wondercraft did, cause I felt I could do it on my own.  I happen to be a software developer, so I’m into this kind of thing.  You can get all the code on GitHub: https://github.com/AdmTal/crowdcast

I generated 40 episodes of Emoji Puzzles, and have scheduled them to post daily, and they should run to June 10th.

But Crowdcast, I make once weekly and post fresh.

I’m here to tell you about episode #3 which just launched, and to give you some behind the scenes tech insights.

Of course, [all of the code is open source](https://github.com/AdmTal/crowdcast) if you’re into that kind of thing - feel free to open a PR, would love to collaborate and get feedback.

Otherwise, it’s pretty simple, I have a [script](https://github.com/AdmTal/crowdcast/blob/main/main.py) that pulls the top three comments every week, and I run them through a [series of prompts](https://github.com/AdmTal/crowdcast/tree/main/prompts) in order to build a full podcast script.  Then I use [Eleven Labs](http://elevenlabs.io) to generate the voice.  I stitch it all together with some music using Python, and then publish it using [Buzzsprout](https://www.buzzsprout.com).  I’m currently using GPT-4 to run the prompts.

For episode 3, I did something new to try and raise the quality of content and keep it interesting, I call it [Prompt enhancement](https://github.com/AdmTal/crowdcast/blob/main/prompts/prompt_enhancer.py).

Here are the user comments used for episode #3 both before and after prompt enhancement:

First, /u/liquidhot [suggested this](https://www.reddit.com/r/crowdcast/comments/13lhis4/vote_now_for_next_weeks_crowdcast_topics_will/jks2etg/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=ios_app&utm_name=ioscss&utm_content=1&utm_term=1&context=3):

    A segment about the lighter side of the dark web and how dark net criminals can come together to make the world a better place.

Which became this after enhancement:

    The dark web is often depicted as a sinister, secret layer of the internet - a place only for illicit activities. But could there also be instances where this mysterious corner of the web has been a force for good? In this segment, we'll delve into concrete examples of hackers and dark web users leveraging their skills for altruistic purposes. We'll discuss the role of hacktivists like the members of Anonymous who exposed high-level corruption in the Tunisian government during the Arab Spring, and highlight cases such as the ransomware attackers - Phineas Fisher - who claimed to have donated their ill-gotten gains to charities like Kurdish anti-capitalists. We'll also examine how the dark web has provided a safe haven for whistleblowers like Edward Snowden, enabling them to share critical information without the fear of facing severe consequences. Join us as we unravel the complex realities and unexpected positive aspects of the dark web communities, and how, in certain instances, they are contributing to a more just world.

Second, /u/tango_foxtrot404 [suggested](https://www.reddit.com/r/crowdcast/comments/13lhis4/comment/jksycbg/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=web2x&context=3):

    A debate segment between 2 artificial intelligences on the question: Are we alone in the universe?

Which became this after enhancing:

    A debate segment featuring two cutting-edge artificial intelligences, each presenting opposing sides of the question: Are we alone in the universe? Drawing on the latest scientific theories, findings, and case studies, both AI debaters will tackle key topics including the Fermi Paradox, the Drake Equation, and the potential of microbial life in our solar system. Listeners will also get a glimpse into the current state of astrobiology, extraterrestrial intelligence research, and the implications of discovering life beyond Earth. As they debate, the AIs will also demonstrate their reasoning skills, natural language understanding, and ability to think and learn on the fly, providing unique and profound perspectives on this age-old question. Join us as we push the boundaries of both cosmic and artificial intelligence in this engaging and thought-provoking segment.

Finally, /u/dramatic-mongoose-95 (me) [suggested](https://www.reddit.com/r/crowdcast/comments/13lhis4/comment/jkpy005/):

    Next weeks episode should have a fiction segment about the dark conspiracy theories surrounding the great British bake-off. The lies, the cheating, the gambling, the calories.

Which became this after enhancement:

    In next week's episode, we dive into the world of culinary intrigue with an exploration of the gripping conspiracy theories surrounding the popular TV show, The Great British Bake-Off. We'll dissect the rumors of lies, cheating, gambling, and the surprising calorie-loaded consequences. Delving into the history of the competition, we'll discuss specific instances where fans have uncovered potential plots to manipulate the outcome--including potential judge favoritism and explosive ingredient scandals. As we wade through these complex webs of whispers, we'll also investigate the claims of a shadowy betting ring operating behind the scenes, and gain insight into the true calorie cost of creating these sumptuous baked masterpieces. Come along with us as we reveal the secrets and scandals behind the oven doors of this beloved cooking competition, and learn how this apparently innocent show has, for some ardent fans, become a field of sinister speculation.

464,1684837354.0,Getting started with generative AI: A beginner’s guide,"Generative AI has revolutionized the way we approach content creation and other content-related tasks such as language translation and question-answering. From OpenAI’s groundbreaking language models-based applications like ChatGPT and DALL-E to Google’s Bard, generative AI is challenging the limits of content creation, transforming the content industry in ways that were once thought impossible.

Trained on vast amounts of data with the use of unsupervised and semi-supervised learning algorithms, generative AI allows for creating new content from scratch. One of the most exciting developments in this field is large language models that enable computer programs to comprehend text and generate new content.

At the heart of generative AI is a neural network that is trained to recognize patterns in data and then use these patterns to generate new content. By using customized parameters during training, generative AI models can make their own conclusions and identify features in the data. This allows them to predict the most relevant patterns to input and generate corresponding content.

Although generative AI is capable of producing incredible results, it still requires human intervention at the beginning and end of the training process to achieve optimal outcomes. Human input is necessary to provide the initial data set, identify the relevant features to be learned by the model and evaluate the output for quality and relevance. The synergy of human and machine intelligence in generative AI enables it to unlock a whole new world of possibilities in the realm of content generation.",,6,1.0,5,https://www.reddit.com/r/generativeAI/comments/13pkgfl/getting_started_with_generative_ai_a_beginners/

Context: I am trying to train a Stable Diffusion model, my supervisor says that it is not a good idea to use just one GPU (I have a 4090), instead it needs at least six for training with a sufficiently large dataset. He is asking me to learn how to use the GPU cluster at the uni. But the issue is that it is very poorly maintained by someone who is not even qualified for the job and at random points in time there are issues with it and obviously, there is an issue with priority.

I need to make MKBHD speak in Chinese in his own voice.

The app would take the sample video, filter out the audio, convert it into text with Assembly AI api and then convert the language in to Hindi - for example

now when we convert to Hindi with ML it doesn't actually works fairly because what we say in Hindi -

for example in Bengali language (similar to Hindi) (roktambor - means rokto (blood) + ambar (costume)) which means a dress blood red in color but google translates this as "" blood clot"" which is completely wrong.

Now we also have a bigger problem to solve which is we have to make sure that with such a small voice dataset of 16 mins the Model should be able to convert the voice of MKBHD to Hindi keeping his tone intact. it should seem that he can speak hindi clearly.

This [repo](https://github.com/cromano8/Snowflake_ML_Intro) contains a zero -> ML model video/materials in under 8 minutes from setting up your free trial -> loading data -> feature engineering -> model training.  Students/educators get 120 days everyone else 30.  I'll add another lesson to the repo on more advanced topics like near real-time/batch inferencing, and model registry but this demo is a very easy-to-follow guide for people new to Snowflake/ML.  If you have any questions feel free to comment and I'll try to answer them.  The class I teach is around Streamlit and I'll be posting some materials on that as well, and will be using all open source stuff for those lessons.

6,1701612350.0,is a degree worth it?,"I have seen many people in this thread/channel discuss the importance of stem degrees to get into the field. I currently have a bachelor's degree in Sociology with foci on data science and data analytics.

I have the opportunity to get a reduced tuition degree, and I'm thinking of getting a data science degree. 

First question - is it worth going back to school to get another degree if i want to enter into data science at some point and not just data analytics?

Second question - If I go back, should I get a second bachelor's in Data Science or add to my current bachelor's and get a Master's? Would there be a difference in what I'm learning per degree? Would one look better/sound better? Does it matter which one I get?

Third question - should I consider something outside of data science as a degree?

11,1701450053.0,How to tell manager I’m leaving after he keeps trying to get me to stay?,"Because of a re-org, I have the chance to move from my team that has a horrible work-life balance, 20+ hours of meetings, but really great projects with high visibility. I can say my projects are actually quite important to the corporation and EC view it. But dealing with my team and having to stay in a city I don’t care for isn’t it. 

The other team I’m re-orging to is much smaller, I actually like the team members compared to my team, have 4 hours max of meetings, but they’re not able to get projects into production, which is why they’e seen churn. 

In my area, I’m always putting projects into production. The area they’re in is more regulated than mine. I don’t feel valued by my manager and honestly, have a lot of resentment towards him. I’ve had to play politics to get the projects I wanted, and then he barely gave me support. I’ve been told no on so many things, and the resentment has just built up. He also wouldn’t allow me a particular tool and has been supporting a newer teammate who’s been annoying me since he gave a project I wanted to this newer person, yet expected me to train him/answer all of their questions even when it was detracting from my work. And I would get the blame for my other work. 

He and the other team’s director have been arguing over me to their manager. They did a formal interview process which I passed. I get so angry during the day that I have to take myself away from work and get work done. 

I want to switch and have told him that I prefer the opportunity, but he wants to continue to have these meetings. Even if I were to switch, I’d have to support both teams until my current team is OK (they have a ton of projects that only I’m doing/have the ability to). 

The new team technically doesn’t need me until February full time, so until then, I’m the child in a Divorce. I’m so resentful towards my manager that I’ve been communicating in writing over speaking since I don’t think I’d be able to not let my resentment show. 

How would you handle this situation? It’s like limbo with my team resenting me if I leave, and also more work if I do switch roles.

The only thing he does say is that the other team doesn’t get models into production, which is true and is a worry of mine. But I can’t continue to work in such a toxic environment and blamed for everything, then praised to business partners/EC. Publically it looks like he’s very supportive to me, but I know how little support I have and how I’ve had to play politics to get anything. Just so much resentment.

12,1701452136.0,Technical Interview: How do you handle intentionally vague data prompts?,"I have a technical interview Monday with a large company, which I'm both excited for and extremely nervous. With that being said, I think I'll be able to handle questions about data storytelling, sql, and basic stats. The one question that I think I'll probably have trouble with is a question regarding your process as an analyst with a vague, unknown purpose (their wording). I drafted the following. Anything I'm missing?

ex. define the problem by asking questions: who is the target audience? what type of data? what is the problem that needs addressing? Is the data clean? Are there outliers? EDA to get acclimated to the dataset.

What I think they are really asking, while being vague, is how I approach a data problem. What should I add to the few questions above?

Thinking something like this might help as a guide?

16,1701410111.0,How long should one continue to transform from a single PCA fit?,"Sorry if I'm asking that in a really odd or unintuitive way. Say I have data from a year ago and use the first months worth and extract the first 2 principal components for visual inspection on density-based clustering. I can use that same fit on the PCA instance to transform the data for the second month and third month and so on. But how can I determine if that change of basis is still appropriate (along the directions of highest variance) for future data? Are there tests for checking this (outside of monitoring for model drift)?

I'm using PCA to provide some level of inspection for density-based clustering. I'm using the clustering labels to train classifiers, so I'm thinking that a change of basis by refitting the PCA instance will trash the classifiers disciminative ability without necessarily voiding the clustering results (specifically a change in k).

Is this possible? I'm wanting to treat changes symptomatically rather than tearing everything down and rebuilding. If it requires that, its not a problem (and part of the pipeline) but it shouldn't be the only reaction to a change in model performance.",WadeEffingWilson,8,1.0,7,https://www.reddit.com/r/datascience/comments/1884j6m/how_long_should_one_continue_to_transform_from_a/

20,1701377656.0,Monolith or Many Repos?,"How does your team use version control?

I’ve worked in 2 companies that did it vastly different:

On one team, everyone model we had have its own repository. I found this made code-sharing and collaboration minimal but was super flexible. I had no worries about pushing to main (I actually always worked out of it lol), never stepped on people’s toes, and could format it however I wanted.

On my most recent team, we use 1 single repo. Every push to main has a PR, we all share code since we’re familiar with each other’s work, and it helps us all the learn from one another. I really like this approach but I can be a burden waiting on PRs to be reviewed and you’re ultimately a bit slower since you spend time doing code reviews.

From a software engineering perspective, two is definitely better. From the perspective of a manager, I could see them preferring the first due to velocity (there could be a counter point here that sharing code and finding bugs before they’re deployed speeds things up too)

Most of the problems that we deal at my team are related to unsupervised anomaly detection in multiple settings (industrial networks, it networks, system logs, iot networks, etc.) for detection of cyberattacks (using traditional and deep learning models). The problem I am facing is that due to the unsupervised nature of these problems and that the data we deal with is not very similar to any known labeled dataset, it turns out to be almost imposible to validate our developments properly (to know if what we are doing is correct) properly. This has led me to feel quite impotent and to develop some kind of impostor syndrome/feeling that I am not learning a lot nor developing meaningful skills.

39,1701166672.0,How to reward good data quality in decision making?,"I ran into an intersting case today, which I would like to discuss. I have changed some details to keep the companies involved anonymous.

The shopping portal GoGreen🍏 allows customers to view the carbon footprint of each item they shop, enabling them to make informed decisions that could minimize their environmental impact. While shopping, the customer sees a bar chart that shows both the stacked CO2 emisions from all the items they have selected so far, and a second bar that that shows the stacked CO2 emisions for alternative items with a smaller footprint.

[An illustration of the described bar chart](https://preview.redd.it/fzl2lt2ud23c1.png?width=400&format=png&auto=webp&s=85cae8280eb2fc32cf5c385af3760efd485f02c9)

Unfortunatelt, not all sub-vendors are able to provide an CO2 estimate for all their items. When this happens, GoGreen🍏 instead relys on an official rapport that have calculated the average carbon footprint for a huge amount of items. This will be an average value based on similar products.

The problem is this: Vendors who are spending their ressources on providing good CO2 estiamates naturally wants to be rewarded for this effort. However, it is not clear how this should be done in a fair way. I see several solutions, but neither are good:

1. If we fill the nan-values based on the averages from the rapport, the averages will sometimes comes out better. This would create an incentive to not rapport the carbon footprint if the vendors suspects they will come out worse than the average
2. If we exclude the nan-values, this will essentailly be the same as saying the footprint is zero, which would insentivice the previous behaviour even more
3. If we penalise the vendors who don't report a CO2 estimate with a ""bad data quality tax"", this will be seen unfair by the user's who don't rapport such estimates (who in many cases have legitimate reasons why they are not able to). And we simply do not have enough data to create a fair penalty.

This whole thing would not be a problem if all vendors either did or did not offer CO2 estimates. However, it becomes a huge fairness-issue when there is a mix. We want to reward good data quality, but is has to be done fairly. We also need to present this in a way that enables customers to make well-informed decisions.

55,1700996066.0,Retail based recommendation system - Setup and how to deal with severe class imbalance?,"I recently took on a project where I am supposed to build a recommendation system which recommends clothes/shoes to customers based on their purchase history. I am relatively new to this field and would like to get some feedback regarding the choices made, learn how others would have approached this, and how to deal with severe class imbalance.

The way the model is set up is the following:

Firstly, I decided to only concentrate on customers who made one or most purchases in the past 90 days to reduce complexity and respect seasonality. In the future I would like to include more customers, as this reduces the customers a prediction is provided for by 2/3 and I think there is probably great value in trying to reach customers that haven't come back in a while rather than those that are buying stuff regularly. However, I haven't given this issue much thought, yet, because I focusing on other aspects.

Secondly, I generate possible candidates per customers by checking what they have previously purchased, bestsellers by gender and type of product, and similarities between users/product characteristics. Additionally, I tried the Tensorflow Recommenders library, but it didn't really improve the model and hence, I decided to not include it for now.

Thirdly, I use a LightGBM Ranker to sort these lists by customer. Moreover, the data is split into train and test sets. Each set consists of 4 months, where the most recent month provides the ground truth and the previous three months are used for the retrieval generation. However, this is where the biggest issues arise. There is extremely severe class imbalance because relevance is evaluated solely based on customers who made at least one purchase in the three months, where the retrieval is based on, and who made at least one purchase in the most recent month. This leads to the model overemphasising on very very few articles that appear to be relevant. Due to the class imbalance most products appear not to be relevant given that simply not enough customers purchase items frequently. Additionally, the performance metrics such as MAP@k are also highly skewed because they are based on such few people. I couldn't really think of much on how to deal with that issue and would like to hear how you would approach this.

Lastly, I apply several filters to remedy some minor issues. For example, the model focuses more on quantity rather than revenue generated from an item. Therefore, socks and underwear are suggested often by the model because they are simply purchased a bunch. Currently, I am just removing items of category socks/underwear in excess of a given threshold. For the future, I am thinking about fixing this by including weights that are inversely related to the quantity purchased and directly to the price. 

So, what do you think about my general approach? Do you see any major flaws in my thinking? And how do you think I should deal with the enormous class imbalance that leads to overemphasising on very few products?

Many thanks in advance and I am curious to hear what you guys think about this project.",vossiplayz,12,0.8,15,https://www.reddit.com/r/datascience/comments/18488s8/retail_based_recommendation_system_setup_and_how/
56,1700949444.0,Change my mind: AI is inherently public domain knowledge and should not be commercialized,"So I want to start out by saying that AI is an incredibly useful, arguably fundamental tool.  LLMs have an amazing potential to aid in productivity, I really feel that AI is going to make personalized healthcare a possibility and there are of course many as of yet undiscovered applications.  We need AI in our lives and it can make the world a better place.

But the scale of data required to train these things necessitates using publicly available data which no one can claim to have developed or collected themselves.  If a company has sales data and it trains AI on that data which they colected and organized, then yes they can claim this is an IP they themselves made and developed.  But we all know these models are of limited generalizability.  And when we think of training say an AI to predict which drug is going to treat a person cancer based on the genotyping of a tumor sample there is simply no way an private enterprise would be able to collect and collate the data needed for that sort of discovery.  It needs to be open access, you can commercialize certain aspects and applications I'm sure.  Like compounds discovered using the model, if you used it to develop those compounds.  But the core model needs to be not for profit and withholding that model past a certain point is harmful to society at large and unjust considering you didn't really build the thing yourself.

Looking forward to counter arguments, refinement of my logic, and healthy discussion.  Be civil lets have a fun talk if you have any thoughts!

**EDIT** ***I wanted to share something a very knowledgeable poster provided about what specific aspects of an LLM (or other advance ML) should be public and what should remain a companies IP.  It's very comprehensive and well thought through:***

>I think the entire set of training data (technically I mean the entire dataset and not in the sense of training, validation, test, or any other subset used for calibration) should be made available, even what is created in-house. I think it's very important that everyone at least have the same access to the data. My reasoning for that is because it is extremely important to ensure that dataset is not biased, which would take a lot of people with a lot of different perspectives to figure out. It also removes the major barrier to entry so hopefully people would focus on innovation, instead of obtaining data. That's it though. Everything else is the spawn of creativity and compute resources and opening them would serve no purpose beyond allowing replication of the product.  
>  
>The parameter weights are the product of the compute time, so once that expense gets high enough, IMO, it really seems like theft to force them to give it away. It would remove the incentive for anyone else to spend more time making a better product. The structure of the models, the order the functions are called, even the way the training data is applied can all make a big difference in performance. So I see that as a creative work requiring a lot of effort which also shouldn't be given away. If the models are only using techniques developed in academia, then anyone can learn those regardless of whether or not any specific company makes their models public (spoiler: they aren't).  
>  
>I would also be supportive of making it a requirement to provide no-cost API access for watchdogs or organizations to ensure an unbiased final model. Like an audit of the final product.

63,1700888817.0,What's the best way to work as a data professional in Europe?,"Hello fellow data lovers👋 

I'm wondering if I could get some advice from the community, especially from the data scientists who've successfully immigrated there from another country without a Euro passport/European family members etc.

Ever since my first trip there a few years back, I've been dying to experience more of the European culture/lifestyle again so I figure I'd really give it a go to move across the pond for a few years while I'm still young without too much responsibilities (coming from NA). But as you've probably heard a million times, the job market is tough and I haven't been getting any call backs from the dozens of applications I've sent out. And I've also only been working professionally as a data analyst for one year so I'm sure that doesn't help when I'm being weighed against plenty of other qualified candidate. Regardless, I want to keep trying because eventually I might catch a job interview or two to give myself a chance to achieve this goal.

What I'm really hoping you folks could help me out with is a strategy for applying to jobs or networking? Basically, does the community have any thoughts on a strategy that would give me the biggest chance to succeed in terms of moving to Europe for a few years? Also before anyone suggests, asking my boss to let me work fully remote is not really an option due to legislations surrounding the data we work with. That said, here are a couple strategies I've been trying so far but I'd be really open to other ideas from the community I haven't given much thought to:

1) Applying for data roles of all kinds to Euro-native companies?

2) Applying for fully remote data roles in North America and living abroad?

3) Applying for roles within multinational companies with offices in countries I'm interested in most to live in (such as France**, Switzerland**, Italy, Greece, the Nordics, Czechia, or Hungary)?

I'm a college junior who'll be starting a 6 month data science co-op with a large national retail company, and I'm wondering if anyone here has any insight on what DS looks like at a company like this. I won't name the company for sake of privacy, but I'm concerned that the job will be a lot of dashboard building, etc and not a ton of modelling, and I'm worried I'll end up spending 6 months as an excel monkey. The job description mentioned modelling and explicitly had Python and whatnot as a requirement, but i was wondering if anyone in retail DS had any advice or experiences to share as I prepare to get started.

(As a note, I do not at *all* view myself as above dashboard building, excel, etc. it's just not what I'm hoping to get out of the co-op, I'm looking to build my skills in modelling, ML, etc., so I promise I'm not trying to come off as pretentious or above that kind of work.

71,1700700042.0,Non-technical boss wants me to present results of a extremely ill-performing model to executives,"My background, in case it's relevant: I have a masters and PhD in data science, and I've been in my first data science role for about a year and a half.


I am a data scientist in a business intelligence department. When I joined, I inherited an extremely poor churn model - like ~10% precision, ~5% recall, ~91% accurate (due to imbalance). This thing was in production for over a year because my manager didn't realize that accuracy is a poor metric to use for imbalanced data.


I've spent the last year and a half redoing this model myself to a place where it is a lot better. But, my manager wants me to present the old model to executives. Now, if this were simply a comparison of the old one and the new one or an examination into why the old one didn't work so well, that would be fine. That's not what he wants. He wants me to present the model as if its predictions are perfect in order to show executives areas that we need to improve on in order to prevent churn.


This... makes no sense. E.g., let's say the old model classified old customers as most at-risk, but it's newer customers who actually churn more. Basing business decisions on the model's poor predictions is a really bad idea. 


To be clear, I don't have a problem making these slides. I have pushed back on the idea behind it, but I've never refused to do it. What I'm concerned about is that it's my name that's going on this and it's going to be presented as my sole effort, albeit from within the department, even though it's a model I had no hand in building whatsoever. My boss also has a tendency to throw people under the bus, and I feel like I'm being sacrificed.


I see a few options:


1. I can carefully word things so that I do not invite any conclusions drawn from my presentation whatsoever and also gently shut down any possible business decisions that might be made from this presentation.


2. I present it the way my boss wants but stay honest when anyone asks about the actual churn results and how much they differ from the model.


So basically, my questions are:


* Do I need to shut up and do as I'm told and act like a cog in the business machine? 


* Is this really normal business practice that I need to get used to? 


* Am I being dramatic?


* Or do I right to have a problem with this request? 


I am coming from academia where every little decision in the modeling process has to be justified and everything gets examined by multiple people, so maybe this is me just struggling to adapt to corporate life.",goatsnboots,243,0.95,88,https://www.reddit.com/r/datascience/comments/181okvd/nontechnical_boss_wants_me_to_present_results_of/

84,1700582779.0,Word of advice on taking on a Data Science masters (from someone who just completed one),"I just graduated with a masters in data science from a uk university. To say it was difficult would be an understatement, and it’s not just the program itself that made it so, but two external factors which (I’ll list below) made studying a challenge. 



1. WORK: If you have a hard job already, DON’T combine it with a data science masters. You could literally breakdown completely due to stress. My school recommend working only 10 hours per week and I ignored the advice because I needed the money. I worked 20 hours per week doing menial jobs. At some point I thought I would actually drop dead due to stress. Keep in mind that 20 hours is still part time work. I strongly recommend working a maximum  10 hours per week or not working at all if you’re prone to stress.   My classmates who worked full time during their masters had very poor grades (some even dropped out). 



2. Family and peer support:  I always thought of myself as a lone journeyman who took on the world without needing to speak to anyone. Uhh…. Yeah that went out the window completely when things got heated during the program. Not seeing family in the flesh  affected my mental health. I noticed that people who took the program with their families  were a lot happier than those of us who didn’t have any family around. Speaking to family, friends and classmates going through the same program really helped A LOT though. You really can’t go through this program as a loner. Life would hit you on the face like a brick for every single day of your existence if you attempt to do so. 

That’s my 2 cents. AA

EDIT: 
Course Selection: Just remembered this but uhh course selection is REALLY IMPORTANT. I had done enough online courses on data science before my masters, to know that neural networks and deep learning is something you study ON YOUR OWN, and  NOT as part of an official course. If you’re new to data science, pick the easiest courses for your masters. I saw enough people completely fail their courses (and subsequently the entire masters) because they wanted courses that sound trendy. Seriously that’s the only reason they chose them.

They don't treat you with any respect anymore,"I was laid off from my company earlier this year after 1.8 years of successful work experience at this company. I was recognized three times over that period, given merit increases in bonuses, shares of stock as rewards. Constantly praised and recognized several times, and never disciplined in any way or even told that my performance was an issue. I was laid off and they admitted that it was not for performance reasons, I was a great employee, they would love to see me work for them again...

So I start reapplying, I'm very dedicated to working for this company, and the interviews that I get are much more challenging than they were when I started with the company. Previously, they asked me about my background, skills, experience, and had me interview with other people on the team. This time around, I had to do case studies that were extremely challenging. One of them I had 3 hours to go through an absurdly complex Excel assignment that involved three separate spreadsheets of data and building a data lookup tool using Excel. Like, creating a tableau report, just using data validation and dropdowns and stuff and conditional formatting I guess? Sounds stupid and I've never done something so crazy so yep I failed hard. Also had another interview based around SQL, which I know like the back of my hand. Aced the interview, and almost got an offer, but disqualified last round.

Then I had another interview for BI engineer position, and they were “disappointed” with me for not speaking to what SQL I’d used. The manager was honestly a douche, I could tell just from his demeanor, and how he acted. Dude seemed like he was barely invested in the interview. It was supposed to be a meet and greet, NOT an interview, that’s verbatim what I was told. Then I get told I should’ve explained size of my SQL queries, how many rows, types of joins. Like uh, it’s a meet and greet to learn more about the role, and YOU did not ask ME any of that either?

It’s just so infuriating.... 3 years ago, we had 1-3 interviews for low to mid level jobs. Now its 3-8 interviews minimum plus 2+ case studies, for ANY JOB. Like, imagine working for a company and being praised for years, now because of ""economic conditions"" hundreds get laid off, and treated like children in interviews to rejoin the firm.

88,1700582182.0,Question for those who have worked with GenAI,"I've been tasked with finding out if we can do a GenAI based chatbot.

\- Take an input (which can be voice to text transcription for a customer service call center agent)  
\- Send that input, via API call, to a vendor (like Open AI or other ones, given the recent stuff maybe we look hard at other vendors)  
\- The API will respond with relevant information

Now this presumes that there is an LLM on the other end of that API call that knows the context of the conversation. If you want to have this work for your call center agents, for example, to help them figure out where to go next with troubleshooting, that LLM would need to be trained on your specific knowledge base (and not a generic ChatGPT3 type open response). That's my understanding at least. So two main questions:  
1) Is my understanding of this general process correct (that it goes via API call to a vendor and you get a response)?  
2) What is the process like for setting up access to a vendor to get that kind of trained LLM? Is there a list of decent vendors out there?

Currently, I'm exploring building a model of customer accounts over time to predict a very infrequent event. \~0.5% of my population would be classified as a positive at any given time. I had been using aggregated features for different attributes over various intervals of time in an attempt to capture some time dynamic. For example, total purchases and total payments might be attributes of interest, so I take the sum of both over the last 1,5,7 days and end up with a 2 dimensional feature matrix containing 6 covariates and I'd feed that into a gradient boosted trees algorithm. I am wondering if it would be worthwhile to explore modeling this problem with a 3 dimensional feature matrix that I could use to train a more advanced type of neural network. Would transformers be a viable path forward here? Or would a simple LSTM or GRU be a better choice? Any good literature on this topic? CNNs are interesting to me as well. I know traditionally they are more suited toward things like image classification, but I wonder if they might also work to help capture more nuanced temporal structure in my data?

From there I would do my data preprocessing in alteryx and export it out into a CSV for python where I do my modeling. I am already proficient in stats/DS and my SQL is up to snuff, I just don’t know what other people use  and their pipeline from SQL to python since our entire org basically only uses Alteryx.

97,1700501391.0,I’m worried the experience I’m accruing at my current job is not useful for when I want to switch,"Hi all, I’ve been working at a consulting firm for about 6 months now and have another 6 months of internships under my belt at the same place.

I’ve posted here and elsewhere before about just how much I do not enjoy working here for various reasons, so I will not delve into the reasons why, but the gist of the matter is that I do eventually want to switch jobs.

I work as a data scientist, but I see so many individuals here and on linkedin posting about how they work with ML algorithms and python data-central frameworks in their day to day. I do none of that.

Since at a consulting firm, the work you do changes on a case to case basis, over the last year or so, I’ve architectured, created, and maintained end to end full stack software, with my primary tech stack being VueJs, NextJs, Python and C#. 

I’m worried that this experience has essentially ruled out the possibility of landing a DS job for me in the future (the last time I did ML related projects was in grad school) but also the fact that since I have to switch between stacks quite often, this makes me less than an ideal candidate for a full stack/front end software job too.

98,1700456471.0,The future of coding in data analytics,"Like a lot of people who studied data science, i spend a lot more of my career looking at analytics, reporting and visualisation these days - lets face it, thats where the bulk of the value and jobs are in most industries.

I spend my first few years working in teams that used R (mostly) or Python. And SQL, obviously. Basically understanding and investigating stuff was done in SQL, visualisation, dashboards, packs were done in R (shout out to ggplot2).

I now work in consulting, where i get to see a lot of industry analytics teams and a lot of the analytics teams i work with these days are ""no code"" teams.

These teams use click and drag tools for ETL, analytics, visualisation and reporting (qlikview, dataiku, power bi, sas EG, alteryx, informatica). There are entire analytics and even engineering functionalities within some companies where noone can code.

Now these tools are expensive as hell - but they are time efficient, reduce a lot of IT risk around data access, and limit the amount of fuckery a single rogue idiot can wreak.

My question is, as these tools become more entrenched in major organisations is there any role for analysts that can code?

To be honest, im biased - i love coding, so i want to believe there is a future for it.

Are there any resources for what best design practice looks like for notebook lead DS for the sake of clear and repeatable analysis/modeling. 


For example:

1. Should non-package functions be defined in notebooks or imported from a separate .py.

2. Handling data imports (all at the top or only for each separate piece of analysis)

3. When to separate notebooks (eg for a model training task would you have data pulling, cleaning, validation, hyper parameter tuning, final training, out-of-sample checks all in one notebook or a folder that contains X ordered notebooks to do those tasks.)



The obvious answer is “do what your team does”, but in case you are in charge of practise or there is no design doc for the team are there good defaults.

Some background. I work as a data scientist.

I have data that I have clustered and so I have labels. Training a classifier on this is trivial but I would like for it to appropriately handle potentially new classes. The pipeline will have massive amounts of data and there's no way to approximate when or how often new classes will appear. Another complication is subclasses but I'll cross that bridge when (and if) it comes up. Right now, I just need to figure out the open-world classification issue.

I figure something like an OC-SVM where I take all currently known classes and consolidate them into a single class to train the SVM on. That way, it can make the distinction between previously seen data and new data. Data that has been seen previously can be sent to the next classifier (one trained on the cluster labels) and all others can be sent to a buffer/queue/bucket for further consideration (eg, recluster to include the new class/es).

I was wondering if there are hypotheses tests or some variants that decide if two classes are separable or not (either linearly or non-linearly). 

Consider the most important image classification problem of the century - cats vs dogs. If I'm given a bunch of cat images and a bunch of dog images, will I be able to give a number describing how easy or how difficult it is to classify them? What kind of tests can give us an indication of the separability of the two classes? If the mean of cat and dog images are say 150 and 220 (assume grayscale), will a t-test of difference of means be sufficient? 

 For a second example, consider malignant vs benign tumor images. These look pretty similar to the untrained eye but to a domain expert (radiologist or physician), they convey totally different meanings. If someone wants to develop a machine learning classifier to classify these images, what kind of checks or tests are necessary?

163,1699790369.0,6 months as a Data Science freelancer,"I have been a freelance Data Scientist for 6 month and I have more job offers than I can manage (I turn down offers every week). 

Some people have written me to get some tips on how to start and get some clients. 
So these are a few things I tried to find clients on Upwork, LinkedIn and in online communities.

1) Look for projects on Upwork. 
Set up a nice profile, showcase your project portfolio, research the market, bid on several projects and be willing to set a cheap rate at the beginning. 
You won't make much money the first month, but you will get exposure, your Upwork rating will improve and you can start to bid on some higher paying jobs. 
In 6 months my rate went up 4 times, so don't think it takes so long to get to a good hourly rate. 

2) Improve and polish your LinkedIn profile. 
Many recruiters will write you here. 
Insert the right keywords on your profile, document your previous work, post something work related every week, if you can. 
This is a long game but pays off because instead of bidding for jobs, in the end the recruiters will start to write you.

3) Join online communities of entrepreneurs.
There are several small businesses that look for Data experts and beyond. They have projects ongoing and want to hire freelancers for a short time. 
You can meet them in these communities. Look for them on Twitter, Discord, Slack, Reddit...
Engage with them, share what you do and soon you will start to get some interest. This type of interaction quickly turns into job opportunities.

4) Write. 
Just create a blog and post regularly. Post about what you do, the tools you have used and so on. Better to post a tutorial, a new tech you tried out, a small model you developed. 
All the successful people I know have this habit. They write and share what they do regularly.

5) Put yourself out there and interact online. 
Maybe one day you share something and it gets retweeted, maybe you pick up a good SEO keyword in your blog, you never know. That's why it's important to increase your exposure. You will increase your chances of getting noticed and potentially land a new client.

6) Be generous 
Once you do the above soon you will be noticed and people will start to contact you. 
They will not offer you a contract. That's not how it works. after all, they don't know you and they don't trust you. But something you wrote hit them. Probably they will ask for your help and advice on a specific issue. 
Give advice on the tech to use, how to solve a problem, how to improve their processes, give as much as you can, be honest and open. Say all you know and you will build trust. 
It's the start of a professional relationship.

7) Be patient
Not all conversations will turn into a job opportunity. Sometimes they lead nowhere, sometimes there is no budget, sometimes it takes months to sign a contract. In my experience maybe 2-3 out of 10 conversations turn into a job offer. 
Accept it. It's normal.

172,1699726304.0,ChatGPT becomes a serious contender for exploratory data analysis,"You likely heard about the recent ChatGPT updates with the possibility to create assistants (aka GPTs) with code generation and interpretation capacities. One of the GPTs provided with this update by OpenAI is a Data Analysis assistant, showing the company already identified this area as a strong application for its tech.

Just by providing a dataset you can start generating some simple or more advanced visualisations, including those needing some data processing or aggregations. This means anyone can interact with a dataset just using plain English.

If you're curious (and have a ChatGPT+ subscription) you can play with this [GPT](https://chat.openai.com/g/g-5CQsMRvyT-international-football-explorer) I created to explore a dataset on International Football Games (aka soccer ;) ).

What makes it strong:

* Interact in simple English, no coding required
* Long context: you can iterate on a plot or analysis as chatGPT keeps memory of the past context
* Capacity to generate plots or run some data processing thanks to its capacity to write and execute Python code.
* You can use ChatGPT's ""knowledge"" to comment on what you observe and give you some hints on trends you observe

I'm personally quite impressed, the results are most of the time correct (you can check the code it generated). Provided the tech was only released a year ago, this is very promising and I can easily imagine such natural language interface being implemented in traditional BI platforms like Tableau or Looker.

It is of course not perfect and we should be cautious when using it. Here are some caveats:

* It struggles with more advanced requests like creating a model. It usually needs mulitple iteration and some technical guidance (e.g. indicating which model to choose) to get to a reasonable result.
* It can make some mistakes that you won't catch unless you have a good understanding of the dataset or check the code (e.g. at some point it ran an analysis on a subset that it generated for a previous analysis while I wanted to run it on the whole dataset). You need to be extra careful with the instructions you give it and double checking the results
* You need to manually upload the datasets for now, which makes non-technical persons still dependent on someone to pull the data for them. Integration with external databases or external apps connected to multiple APIs will soon come to fix that, it is only an integration issue.

It will definitely not take our jobs tomorrow but it will make business stakeholders less reliant on technical persons and might slightly reduce the need for data analysts (the same way tools like Midjourney reduce a bit the dependence on artists for some specific tasks, or ChatGPT for Copywriters).

Below are some examples of how you can easily require for a plot to be created with a first interpretation.

174,1699791514.0,I've been asked to write my own job description - what do I say,"Hello everyone,

I'm at a crossroads in my career and am seeking advice to prepare for an important upcoming meeting where I'll be discussing my 3-5 year career objectives, clarifying my role, and identifying the support I might need.

**Background**

I am 18 months into a role as data analyst at a small company specializing in e-commerce logistics, including airfreight and final mile deliveries. My role combines financial accounting with data analysis, primarily using Power BI. I bring a unique combination of skills and experience from the previous more traditional finance postitions in the industry to this role and in my time here have signifcantly uplifted the management reporting. I pride myself on strong problem-solving abilities, intellectual rigor, and a flexible yet methodical work approach.

The company is in a great position with significant growth potential, and I have great faith in our leadership team. I am eager to take a senior postition in the company and to drive a stronger data-driven approach in business analysis and reporting.

**Immediate Challenges and Areas for Discussion**

One of my main challenges is developing strong connections within the company and I often feel 'out of the loop' on key issues.

Additionally, my role lacks clear definition, especially in terms of over lapping responsibilities with the incumbent finance manager who has been with the company for 15 years. This meeting is a crucial opportunity to address this, and I’ve effectively been asked to 'write my own job description'.

Another issue is my tendency to get overly absorbed in project details, sometimes losing sight of the bigger picture. I plan to seek project management support to improve in this area.

While I have strong technical skills and a good understanding of the business, I recognize that I need to enhance my interpersonal skills. I'm committed to the company and keen to succeed but need guidance on these next steps.

I would greatly appreciate any insights, particularly from those who've navigated similar paths or have experience in defining roles and setting long-term objectives in data-centric positions. How did you define your role in a way that aligned with your career goals and company needs? Any tips on improving interpersonal skills in a professional setting?

178,1699666736.0,How should data science employees be evaluated?,"It is known that most of the data science initiatives fail. For most companies, the return on investment for data science teams is far lesser than a team of data analysts and data engineers working on a business problem. In some orgs, data scientists are now being seen as resource hoggers, some of who have extremely high salaries but haven't delivered anything worthwhile to make a business impact or even to support a business decision.

Other than a few organizations that have been successful in hiring the right talent and also fostering the right ecosystem for data science to flourish, it seems that most companies still lack data maturity. While all of the companies seem to have a ""vision"" to be data-driven, very few of them have an actual plan. In such organisations,  the leadership themselves do not know what problems they want to solve with data science. For the management it is an exercise to have a ""led a data team"" tag in their career profiles. 

The expectation is for the data scientists to find the problems themselves and solve them. Almost everytime, without a proper manager or an SME, the data scientists fail to grasp the business case correctly. Lack of business acumen and the pressure of leadership expectations to deliver on their skillsets, makes them model the problems incorrectly. They end up building low confidence solutions that stakeholders hardly use. Businesses then either go back to their trusted analysts for solutions or convert the data scientists into analysts to get the job done. 

The data scientists are expected to deliver business value, not PPTs and POCs, for the salary they get paid. And if they fail to justify their salaries, it becomes difficult for businesses to keep paying them. When push comes to shove, they're shown the door. 

Data scientists, who were once thought of as strategic hirings, are now slowly becoming expendables. And this isn't because of the market conditions. It is primarily because of the ROI of data scientists compared to other tech roles. And no, a PhD alone does not generate any business value, neither does leetcode grinding, nor does an all-green github profile of ready-made projects from an online certification course the employee completed to become job ready. 

But here's the problem for someone who has to balance between business requirements and a technical team - when evaluated on the basis of value generated, it does not bode well with the data science community in company, who feel that data science is primarily a research job and data scientists should be paid for only research, irrespective of the financial and productivity outcomes.

In such a scenario, how should a data scientist be evaluated for performance?

For whatever reason, my team has recently hired a few unqualified MBAs to do management work in the data science space and honestly I think it was the biggest fuck up they've ever made. 

So here are the top 5 things I dislike:
1. Condescending micromanagers. It's not enough that you have daily standup, they want to bug you after lunch and before the day is over to get a ""status report"". Like bro fuck off this is data science not supply chain management. 
2. Too many middle managers (Incompetence meets big egos and we have a middle manager)
3. Daily standups. Most data science peojects are better suited for twice weekly check-ins with ad-hoc meetings between ICs as needed. 
4. General imbalance of management to individual contributors. Every project I've been on is like 8 business people and 2 data scientists and it's completely unnecessary. The data scientists do all of the work while the business people circle jerk strategy that doesn't make sense at all in the context of the data and we litterally have to show them why their idea doesn't make sense on every project multipled times, we're basically training them all over time and it's really unnecessary. 
5. I spend way too much time in meetings to be an IC data scientist. I spend 20 to 25 hours a week in meetings on average and I have to actively participate in all of them....

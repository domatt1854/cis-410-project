98,jseaaaw,1689642576.0,"Generically speaking, there are a couple of different things that stop this from happening.

1. Your computer likely has more than one processor. For example,  if your computer had 8 processors, (assuming one processor could only run one app at a time) it could run 8 programs at once, each with its own individual set of registers. Changing a register on one processor would have no effect on any of the other processors, as they are in completely different locations on your chip. So in that case, any given program would not interfere with another's data/registers. This, in part, allows for applications to be multi-threaded; as you can run code in parallel using multiple CPUs at the same time. However, it's unlikely that your computer wouldn't be trying to use all of your processors at any given moment, as that's kind of a waste of resources. So, that's where context switching comes in.
2. Context switching is a way for one CPU to be able to run multiple programs without affecting one another. This is usually done by your operating system (windows, linux, etc.). It requires saving the entire state of the thread (every register, where you are in the program, the entire stack) to be able to get back to that state later if it switches back. This is, of course, a little expensive as copying/moving states is not instantaneous. It also affects the cache, as now the new thread being run on the processor must get its own data into the processor's cache. But generally speaking, that is what's preventing you from changing data between multiple programs.

This allows you to do whatever you want in your given program, and, unless it crashes your computer, it will not affect any other programs running at the ""same"" time. As far as your program is aware, another ever changes during a context switch. It's almost like your program just blacks out for a very short amount of time and then picks up exactly in the spot it was left in; It is none the wiser.

In the case of running the other program on a different processor, even if there was no such thing as context switching, the two programs would never affect each other's registers because your computer could just use an entirely different CPU altogether. But again, your computer would likely try to utilize every processor so, therefore, context switching is needed.","<div class=""md""><p>Generically speaking, there are a couple of different things that stop this from happening.</p>

It requires saving the entire state of the thread (every register, where you are in the program, the entire stack) to be able to get back to that state later if it switches back. This is, of course, a little expensive as copying/moving states is not instantaneous. It also affects the cache, as now the new thread being run on the processor must get its own data into the processor&#39;s cache. But generally speaking, that is what&#39;s preventing you from changing data between multiple programs.</li>
</ol>

<p>This allows you to do whatever you want in your given program, and, unless it crashes your computer, it will not affect any other programs running at the &quot;same&quot; time. As far as your program is aware, another ever changes during a context switch. It&#39;s almost like your program just blacks out for a very short amount of time and then picks up exactly in the spot it was left in; It is none the wiser.</p>

<p>In the case of running the other program on a different processor, even if there was no such thing as context switching, the two programs would never affect each other&#39;s registers because your computer could just use an entirely different CPU altogether. But again, your computer would likely try to utilize every processor so, therefore, context switching is needed.</p>

101,jto886a,1690470602.0,"Technically, you are correct. A computer can only run one program and uses the registers for that one program only. In the old days, if you wanted to run a different program, you would have to get out the tape and punch cards and edit the program memory directly. We got past this by making computers run a special type of program called an Operating System. An operating system is a single program that manages the creation and execution of many other programs (called ""processes""). When you have a background task running, this is simply one of the many processes running on your operating system (upwards of 100 a lot of the time). This is actually the sole purpose of the operating system. There are other things, but they are always there to aid in managing and executing multiple programs.

Others have mentioned the specifics, like how exactly the computer is able to execute multiple processes at once. There are many things that come into play here. Multiple cores (sets of registers+ALU+cache) in the CPU allow different processes to run on different cores simultaneously, the OS constantly rapidly switches which process is currently executing (context switching) to make progress on multiple of them simultaneously, a subprogram of the OS called the ""scheduler"" may decide which processes get more priority and when to perform context switches.

Lots of things to consider, but the main answer to your question is that the operating system is designed to do specifically what you asked using a variety of techniques!

If you don't know any computer science at all, I'd recommend the trinity of [Computer Science Distilled](https://code.energy/computer-science-distilled/) (a good CS101 text), [Intro to Computing](https://www.davidjoyner.net/books/) (uses Python to teach computing), [Grokking Algorithms](https://www.manning.com/books/grokking-algorithms-second-edition) (or perhaps [DPV](https://cseweb.ucsd.edu/~dasgupta/book/index.html) if you have a strong discrete maths and logic background). IMO DPV is the better algorithms book overall, but its brevity sometimes works against it, especially for people unfamiliar with CS and mathematics.

I think your learning journey should go something like (CS101 concepts --> Basic programming --> Basic algorithms --> Intermediate and advanced topics).

The first of these, in particular, should give you a clear sense of what parts of CS interest you the most, which should guide any future learning (the 'intermediate and advanced topics' part), whether self-directed or formal education. A lot of people get into CS for software engineering, but there's an entire other side to it - stuff like systems design, computer architecture, algorithm design and analysis (spoiler: mathsy stuff), human-computer interaction, AI and robotics, graphics and VR/AR, embedded systems... You name it. (I can name a few resources for areas that interest me, but that would probably make this comment too long. Later on, though, I'll be glad to elaborate on your domains of interest if I can.)

For project ideas: Most books on coding have great exercises to help you think about design and implementation. [No Starch Press](https://automatetheboringstuff.com/) has an entire series teaching you through hands-on projects. With a bit of creative thinking, you can use the examples as a guide to come up with project ideas on your own as well.

My number one tip would be: When you're done with basic algorithms stuff, don't *just* go for learning more languages and libraries/frameworks. That's helpful, sure, but it's not domain knowledge. Languages are just means of expressing concepts, and while learning C or Lisp (God's own programming language) or Haskell as someone who started with Python, or just diversifying your Python abilities by picking up NumPy, Pandas, OpenCV, and more has enormous returns, you can often do that alongside learning concepts. e.g. pick up C while you're also learning operating systems concepts.","<div class=""md""><p>I&#39;m a bit of an old-school fellow and prefer reading a good book (of course with hands-on stuff for a practical subject like CS).</p>

Now, why is it different if we want to check is number of ""ab"" and number of ""ba"" are equal?  Because, they are equal if and only if the string starts and ends with the same letter.  You can write some examples down and try it out, it will make sense.

So now, all we need to check is if the starting and the ending letters are same. We don't really need to keep track of number of ""ab"" and ""ba"", hence stack is not required.

>By using pumping lemma I can prove that there will be an imbalance of substring as n in y\^n increases which proves that both languages are non-regular. Can someone explain to me how my prof is correct?

This is an important statement, but I think it's also irrelevant. If you had instead said ""of course you can't judge whether the Halting-Solving TM works based on its output on this faulty input"" I would agree with you. It just got as input a machine and no input for that machine, why would you expect a sensible answer from it?

But nonetheless the Halting-Solving TM will do some actions based on this faulty input and this Halting-Solving TM will either halt or not halt. For instance it can just realise that its input is faulty and halt. Or it can see that its input is faulty and out of annoyance it can enter an infinite loop. Just because it's not the input you're expecting doesn't invalidate it from being a TM that has gotten an input and is taking actions. If you can solve the Halting problem you should be able to analyse what the Halting-Solving TM does even in this case.

If you go through the proof again with this in mind, I hope it will be more clear.","<div class=""md""><blockquote>

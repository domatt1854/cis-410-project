1,1686430573.0,/r/ComputerScience will be going dark starting June 12th in protest against Reddit's API changes which will kill 3rd party apps & tools,"## Update (June 16th, 2023):

This subreddit remains closed to new submissions and comments as part of the ongoing protest over Reddit policy changes. However, we've chosen to switch the subreddit to read-only, so that existing user contributions will not be censored.

# What's going on?

A recent Reddit policy change threatens to kill many beloved third-party mobile apps, making a great many quality-of-life features not seen in the official mobile app **permanently inaccessible** to users.

On May 31, 2023, Reddit announced they were raising the price to make calls to their API from being free to a level that will kill every third party app on Reddit, from Apollo to Reddit is Fun to Narwhal to BaconReader to Sync.

Even if you're not a mobile user and don't use any of those apps, this is a step toward killing other ways of customizing Reddit, such as Reddit Enhancement Suite or the use of the old.reddit.com desktop interface.

This isn't only a problem on the user level: many subreddit moderators depend on tools only available outside the official app to keep their communities on-topic and spam-free.

# What's the plan?

On June 12th, [many subreddits](https://reddit.com/r/ModCoord/comments/1401qw5/incomplete_and_growing_list_of_participating/) will be going dark to protest this policy. Some will return after 48 hours: others will go away *permanently* unless the issue is adequately addressed, since many moderators aren't able to put in the work they do with the poor tools available through the official app. This isn't something any of us do lightly: we do what we do because *we love Reddit*, and we truly believe this change will make it impossible to keep doing what we love.

The two-day blackout isn't the *goal*, and it isn't the end. Should things reach the 14th with no sign of Reddit choosing to fix what they've broken, we'll use the community and buzz we've built between then and now as a tool for further action.

What can *you* do?

1. **Complain.** Message the mods of r/reddit.com, who are the admins of the site: message /u/reddit: submit a [support request](https://support.reddithelp.com/hc/en-us/requests/new): comment in relevant threads on r/reddit, such as [this one](https://www.reddit.com/r/reddit/comments/12qwagm/an_update_regarding_reddits_api/), leave a negative review on their official iOS or Android app- and sign your username in support to this post.

1. **Spread the word.** Rabble-rouse on related subreddits. Meme it up, make it spicy. Bitch about it to your cat. Suggest anyone you know who moderates a subreddit join us at our sister sub at r/ModCoord - but please don't pester mods you don't know by simply spamming their modmail.

1. **Boycott and spread the word...to Reddit's competition!** Stay off Reddit entirely on June 12th through the 13th- instead, take to your favorite non-Reddit platform of choice and make some noise in support!

1. **Don't be a jerk.** As upsetting this may be, threats, profanity and vandalism will be worse than useless in getting people on our side.

3,1686513814.0,Question About Registers,"Hello everyone. There is a misunderstanding I have somewhere that I would like to clear up. 

I know that CPU registers are very fast and small and we can work with registers by writing assembly.

Here is where my misunderstanding/what I don't get lies: when I was taking my Architecture course, we had assignments where we had to program simple programs in assembly, like, say, a simple sort or something. 

If a program is running on the machine already, say I have a chat client running in the background on the machine, are the registers not in use running that program? How is it that I can write a sorting program in assembly moving values around to registers if the registers are already working with other data? Is there somehow no overlap?

What am I missing here?

If I want to MOV some value into some register like eax or something writing a program in assembly, how is there no other information there already such that I am overwriting or affecting other programs that are running?",mellowhorses,66,0.97,25,https://www.reddit.com/r/computerscience/comments/1473r8s/question_about_registers/

7,1686409304.0,Best Practices using LaTeX.,"I have just finished my first seventy page thesis in LaTeX and would like to share my tips with you on your way and would also like to hear your tips for using TeX here below the post.

I started TeX locally on my computer with TeXShop. Unfortunately, my computer broke down while I was working. I could only restore parts of my work through my backups. Partly I wanted to work on other computers. For me personally, Overleaf ([https://www.overleaf.com/](https://www.overleaf.com/)) has turned out to be a very good companion as an editor in the browser. Overleaf also gave very good formatting tips during the work with regard to creating tables, missing parameters using BiBTeX and much more.

I used Zotero ([https://www.zotero.org/](https://www.zotero.org/)) as library management software. In particular, I quickly lost track of what was relevant to my work and where. With the browser add-on, I was able to save the sources relatively quickly and create my bibliography in BiBTeX format.

Make backups of your interim work at any time. Even if Overleaf saves your results online, you should create backups that contain the entire source code. The Pro version even offers Git integration.

To create notes for my work in the meantime I can strongly recommend the Todo package (to be imported with \\usepackage{todonotes}). Using the command \\todo{your note} you can then mark corresponding paragraphs at the right place.

Since LaTeX sometimes places graphics elsewhere, I can also recommend the package placins. With its help you can limit the placement to certain sections. The package can be imported using (\\usepackage\[section\]{placeins}) with the parameter section for section-limiting.

My thesis also has programming code in the appendix. To format it code-wise I highly recommend the package listings (to be imported using \\usepackage{listings}) 

These were my biggest helpers, I hope I can be of some help to one or the other of you. If you are also currently working on a TeX project. Otherwise, I am very curious about your tips.

9,1686345949.0,I don't understand the Halting Problem,"The key to the solution, from what I've got so far, is imagining a machine that can detect whether or not another machine halts. We'll call that machine H, that takes as input a machine Q

Then, with some simple logic, we can make a machine that halts when H detects Q doesn't halt, and that doesn't halt when it detects Q halts. That'd be Hn

So, with this machine Hn, the paradox would emerge by doing Hn(Hn), since now, if it were to halt, it shouldn't halt, but if it doesn't halt, it should halt. Paradox.

But, one key thing I don't get: Doesn't the internal Hn also need an input? And wouldn't all of the subsequent machines need an input as well, until we reach a static program?

So instead of being Hn(Hn), shouldn't the paradox only arrive if you do Hn(Hn(Hn(...))) forever? and at that point the paradox isn't thanks to the algorithm, but rather because it's a [supertask](https://youtu.be/ffUnNaQTfZE).

&#x200B;

The same could be said if you build a machine that takes another machine (one that halts) as an input outputs 0 when the original outputs 1, and outputs 1 when the original outputs 0, let's call that one N

N(N) should also be a paradox, no? After all, if N outputs 0, it should output 1, but if it were to output 1, it should output 0!

If you don't provide an internal input for the machine you are using as input, of course you can't analyze how it's going to run.",androt14_,50,0.88,47,https://www.reddit.com/r/computerscience/comments/145hbhu/i_dont_understand_the_halting_problem/

21,1686146010.0,What kind of text-file format is the best for specifying trees.,"Hello.

I'm playing with the thought of writing a program  for rendering trees.

In the first instances, they are just rendered in the command line window as a regular tree.

I want to just make a text file to be parsed as a tree, with the bare minimum of fuzz, so it is as easy as possible to define a tree, but with as little amount of ambiguity as possible. And it should be easy to edit the definition, add delete
nodes and so on.

I have thought of using markdown headings for speciffying levels, but thinks that even that is a little too much.

As I see it I have two alternatives that are viable:

* tab indentation 

    root
        level1
             level 2
        level1
             level 2
                 And so on

* markdown headers, much like the first one.

I think, having to make the user write it as a tree is implemented in an array is too much.

I wonder if I am overlooking some other options for defining a tree by a text file, which is just as easy. (I have considered numbering, but thinks renumbering will be too big a chore.)

**Edit**

I want a file format as simple as possible for being able to parse a text file as an inorder binary tree, with as little markup as humanly possible, and yet leave as little room as possible for ambiguities.

The motivation behind this, is to lower the threshold for drawing a graph down to nothing. The end goal, is to output pic scripts you can edit further, and then have pic render the diagrams as svg or whatever format available.

Hello there!

After three weeks of learning the basics of graphs, I think it is time to show you examples of how we can translate real-life problems to the graph theory domain

This will be the last of a series of posts introducing the basic concepts of graph theory before we dive into topics such as traversals, and finding cycles, among others.

Here’s a summary of what we have covered in the previous editions:

1. Introduction to the concepts of [nodes, edges, and connectivity](https://albexl.substack.com/p/introduction-to-graph-theory).
2. Defining what are [neighbors, degrees, and colorings](https://albexl.substack.com/p/an-introduction-to-graphs-ii) in graphs.
3. How to [represent graphs](https://albexl.substack.com/p/graphs-representation) in a computer program.

Today, we will learn about practical examples of how to use graphs in real life. For that, we are going to see examples of “games” that are played on boards. They might seem unrelated to graphs, but the truth is that they are more closely related than you might think.

At the end of the post, you will find some algorithmic challenges so you can try and apply some of the topics that I will explain today. Feel free to skip to that part if you think you already have the necessary skills to solve them.

Let’s begin!

## An Initial Problem

Let’s dive in straight to the matter. Take a look at the following problem and think about how you would approach it:

https://preview.redd.it/krf1rmu0nr3b1.png?width=1304&format=png&auto=webp&s=c6890cc02f7ecafa3327f392163608c2660c39d1

By simple inspection, we can notice that there are three “sets“ of floor tiles that can be identified as “rooms“. These are all the rooms highlighted and numbered: 

https://preview.redd.it/skr7qk73nr3b1.png?width=649&format=png&auto=webp&s=974ae5fafd8e618a05834c62ccb1dc555baf635d

Intuitively, we identify these “connected“ regions and we sort them out as “rooms” because it just makes sense in our heads.

But what if this was the input to a program? How could we design an algorithm that a computer will execute to find the number of “rooms” in any map of a house that uses this representation?

Well, unfortunately, before thinking about designing algorithms we have to think about modeling this problem in terms that a computer can understand. And one possibility, as you might have suspected already, is doing so by using graphs.

## Representing Boards as Graphs

Let’s talk about a classical way of representing boards using graphs. Take a look at the following problem and try to think of a solution.

This time go a bit further and try to think of a general solution, instead of just solving this particular instance. It’s ok if you can’t, I will show you how to do it soon.

https://preview.redd.it/f04jvvg6nr3b1.png?width=1304&format=png&auto=webp&s=f4eb98877382658edbc5f182e3f522126ce6c5c3

Once again, our brains might identify that there are only two paths between the highlighted squares, and we can easily spot which one is the shortest: 

https://preview.redd.it/j8b1n009nr3b1.png?width=1555&format=png&auto=webp&s=2b62fe71c2b3091ed3735d24b3d9cbf575d29002

The path shown on the left takes 9 steps while the one on the right takes 11 steps.

But, who defined what a path is in this problem? Who defined which tiles we can move to when standing on a specific tile?

Our brains (or at least mine) intuitively assumed that the possible moves from a given position were the following:

https://preview.redd.it/v7qf7k0bnr3b1.png?width=256&format=png&auto=webp&s=204d5817b885b926f020b7479fdc84fef4cc64e5

So, as long as we are not trying to go to a “wall” tile, we can move to the left, right, up, or down.

Let’s take this set of movements and the “floor“ tiles and see how they relate to graphs. Assuming that the start and end tiles are also floor tiles, we can number every floor tile arbitrarily like this:

https://preview.redd.it/jwkf1lohnr3b1.png?width=649&format=png&auto=webp&s=c1e17e2971c1c99f9a658111f0a9646be0a27ade

We have 14 “floor” tiles, which can be represented as 14 nodes of a graph. So, what about the edges?

Let’s add an edge between two pairs of nodes if it exists a valid movement between their corresponding tiles on the map. For example, we can add edges between nodes 1 and 2, and also between nodes 13 and 14.

That being said, our problem can be reduced to finding the path with the minimum length between two nodes in an undirected graph.

This is the graph that results from taking every floor tile as a node and adding edges according to the valid moves that we defined:

https://preview.redd.it/u94iiezjnr3b1.png?width=2195&format=png&auto=webp&s=33388b27b52c9b19d444a51fd51b264f9248d7fa

The problem of finding a path with the minimum length between two nodes is a standard problem in the graph theory domain, and we will learn how to solve it in future posts of this series.

For the moment, let’s go back to our initial problem and try to model it using graphs applying what we learned from this example.

## Counting the Rooms

Let’s recall the problem we saw at the beginning of this post:

https://preview.redd.it/q63774ymnr3b1.png?width=1304&format=png&auto=webp&s=924e910b5767e9b60a7746efb2a798491bb6c585

Let’s number every floor tile, and assume that we have the same possible moves that we described above. That is, from a given tile we can move to the tiles at its right, left, top, and bottom as long as they are not “wall“ tiles.

A possible numbering could be the following:

https://preview.redd.it/bgtr6e0pnr3b1.png?width=649&format=png&auto=webp&s=3d451e28cf81d8ec82a07fcf60ea7ac9bd4fcfda

 Translating this map to a graph the same way we did before, we get the following: 

https://preview.redd.it/bz9ymsjqnr3b1.png?width=806&format=png&auto=webp&s=0311f27afc7d52f5a7f3cfde5c5a36d250c30b2c

And if we were to solve the problem of counting the number of rooms in a graph, we could rephrase that as counting the number of its [connected components](https://albexl.substack.com/p/introduction-to-graph-theory).

See all the “rooms“ taken to the domain of connected components below:

https://preview.redd.it/2xc3ctrtnr3b1.png?width=1742&format=png&auto=webp&s=305209b6f203bc9cf9921b2e15698aa1e05c736c

As you also might suspect, the problem of finding the connected components in an undirected graph is also a standard problem that can be solved by using various graph algorithms.

We will be covering those algorithms and more in future editions of Algorithmically Speaking.

In the meantime, it’s time to try what you’ve learned!

## Test Your Skills

I have seen a variety of challenges and puzzles on boards that I would like to share some of them with you today.

I would suggest that you try to focus first on solving them by any means possible and then try to think about how to model this problem using a bit of graph theory.

As I [promised before](https://albexl.substack.com/p/one-month-of-algorithmic-posts), no more plain-text statements. Here we go:

**Problem #1:**

https://preview.redd.it/xgj16v8znr3b1.png?width=1533&format=png&auto=webp&s=0e2c4b2ada71956c934bff787cdc79f71f0f93a3

 **Problem #2:**

https://preview.redd.it/za6no143or3b1.png?width=1304&format=png&auto=webp&s=ed8e954472dbe4201880e15f851e254ded26fc87

## Conclusions

I hope I was able to keep igniting your passion for graph theory by showing you some basic guidelines on how to model board problems using graphs.

This approach is used in numerous real-life applications (at the top of my mind I can think of numerous examples related to the gaming industry).

Also, I recently stumbled upon this [video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZMQbHMgK2rw&t=795s) where I found out about a competition that has been going on for more than 50 years and has a lot to do with boards, mazes, and of course, graphs.

Some takeaways:

* Board problems can usually be modeled as graphs by taking some set of tiles as the nodes and the possible moves between the tiles as the edges.
* Usually, board games involve tasks such as counting regions, or finding paths which are usually standard problems of the graph theory domain.
* The chessboard is a [bipartite graph](https://albexl.substack.com/p/an-introduction-to-graphs-ii). Do you see it now?

I wish you good luck when solving this week’s challenges. Don’t forget to share your progress with the community!

If you think this post can be helpful for someone, share it with them. Nothing will make me happier!

50,1685640992.0,A Manifesto for Cloud-Oriented Programming from the creator of the CDK,"In this [insightful article](https://docs.winglang.io/blog/2022/11/23/manifesto), Elad Ben-Israel, the mind behind the CDK, shares his love for the cloud, but also his frustrations with the complexity of building cloud applications. The challenges he identifies include:
1. Focus on non-functional mechanics: The need to understand and manage cloud platform mechanics instead of focusing on building valuable features for users.
2. Lack of independence: Developers often need to rely on others to handle parts of the deployment process or to resolve issues, interrupting their work flow.
3. Delayed feedback: The current iteration cycle in cloud development can take minutes or even longer, significantly slowing down the development process and making it harder for developers to stay in their flow state.

## It's not just a rant
Elad is not just ranting about cloud development. He proposes a solution in the form of a programming language for the cloud. This language would treat the entire cloud as its computer. The language compiler will be able to see the complete cloud application, unbound by the limits of individual machines. Such a compiler would be able to handle a significant portion of the application's non-functional aspects, enabling developers to operate at a more abstract level, thus reducing complexity and promoting autonomy. Moreover, it could expedite iteration cycles by allowing to compile applications to quick local simulators during the development process. 

## The Winglang Project
Elad reveals that he's in the process of developing such an open-source, “cloud-oriented” language, dubbed [Winglang](https://github.com/winglang/wing). Wing aims to improve the developer experience of cloud applications by enabling developers to build distributed systems that leverage cloud services as first-class citizens. This is achieved by integrating infrastructure and application code in a secure, unified programming model. Wing programs can be executed locally via a fully-functional simulator or deployed to any cloud provider.

## My Interest in Winglang
I, together with a group of dedicated contributors, joined forces with Elad to develop Winglang.
While still in Alpha and not yet ready for production use, it's already possible to build some [real applications](https://github.com/winglang/research/tree/main/dogfooding).

54,1685557044.0,Need help (newbie) - Church-encoded Booleans,"Hi everyone,

I don't know where to ask, so I come to this place. I know that we're not to ask questions regarding programming issues in this subreddit, but I didn't find any programming subreddit (including lisp, scheme and the like) that felt appropriate because I'm stuck at the theoretical, mathematical, logical level.

I'm taking CS classes at Uni, but it's a non-standard ""lateral"" track, so we're to study a lot of stuff on our own. I'm currently trying to get a grasp on the lambda calculus because I feel it is helpful for functional programming.

I'm at a loss when it comes to understanding Church booleans.

(I know ""normal"" booleans from programming languages like Java, were you set x (or boolean x) = true or ask whether x == 5 or 4 == 7 which might evualuate to true or false).

So, my ""hang-up"":

Church convention:

true ≡ λa.λb. a

false ≡ λa.λb. b

If you use beta reduction, true gives you back whatever you use and discards λb.

λa.λb. a (5)

\----> 5

but

λa.λb. b (5)

\----> 5

...that is the same and \_almost\_ like the identity function. This, I don't understand.

But my bigger problem, which, of course, probably arises from not properly understanding Church booleans in the first place, is if-then.

if ≡ λp.λa.λb. p a b

How do I go from here to ""choosing λa if true and λb if false""?

My first try was obviously BS because I used the bound variables of λa and λb for λp, which was not so smart.

\[This was my try for ""True"":

    λp.λa.λb. p a b                      (TRUE) a b
    λp.λa.λb. p a b                      (λa.λb. a) a b
    λa.λb. ( (λa.λb. a) a b)              a b
    λa.λb.  ((λb. a)  b)                  a b

eeerm...what?....oops.

... yeah, didn't make sense. I don't think I can use a and b when it comes to p because they are already lambda-bound?)

&#x200B;

How does p --> TRUE ""trigger"" an output of λa and p --> FALSE λb?

&#x200B;

Thank you so much in advance!

66,1685178618.0,A Visual Introduction to how we represent Graphs in a Computer Program,"Hello there!

Today we will be diving into one of the most common ways of representing data and modeling problems (and solutions) in Computer Science. We will be talking about **Graphs**.

This is the third of a series of posts introducing graph theory in a very visual way.

Now that we know some basic definitions of graph theory, it is time to see how graphs can be represented in a program. We will explore the most common representations and analyze their pros and cons.

**This is a summary version of the weekly edition of the Algorithmically Speaking newsletter. You can read the full article here:**

[Algorithmically Speaking - #5: Representing Graphs](https://albexl.substack.com/p/graphs-representation)

 Let’s begin! 

 \_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_ 

## Edge List

The first representation we will explore today is the **edge list** representation. As its name implies, it consists of a **list** with the **edges** of the graph.

An edge in this list consists of an ordered pair (x, y), representing that there is an edge from node x to node y.

Let’s look at the following graph, where we have numbered the nodes from 1 to 5, and look at the corresponding edge list representation:

https://preview.redd.it/z91ljjiu8c2b1.png?width=3423&format=png&auto=webp&s=758ab0e180d88bfb0ca0497c94fe513bc91973b3

Notice that this graph is **directed**. If the pair (x, y) is present in the list, there is an edge starting in x and ending in y, but the opposite does not hold unless the pair (y, x) also appears in the list.

If the graph is **undirected**, then the edge list representation will contain the ordered pairs (x, y) and (y, x) for every pair of adjacent nodes x and y.

If we would like to represent a **weighted** graph, the most natural way to do it is by extending our representation of an edge to be a triplet instead of a pair.

Let’s say we have edges starting from node x, ending in node y, with a weight of w. One way to represent those edges would be with a triplet of the form (x, y, w).

Let’s add some weights to our previous graph and see what its edge list representation would look like:

https://preview.redd.it/0ou8n7bz8c2b1.png?width=3690&format=png&auto=webp&s=97483bb05e0f23c55b416101c2269806c6ff9830

The edge list representation is particularly useful for algorithms that process the edges of the graphs in some order. We will be exploring some of those algorithms when dealing with the **Minimum Spanning Tree** or the **Dynamic Connectivity** problems.

But this will be in future posts. In the meantime, let’s move on to the next representation.

## Adjacency Matrix

An **adjacency matrix** is a two-dimensional array indicating the edges of the graph. Let’s denote this matrix as G.

Each value G\[x\]\[y\] indicates whether the graph contains an edge from node x to node y. If the edge is included in the graph, then G\[x\]\[y\] = 1, and otherwise G\[x\]\[y\] = 0.

Let’s take a look at our initial graph and its corresponding adjacency matrix:

https://preview.redd.it/ay9r81sh9c2b1.png?width=4350&format=png&auto=webp&s=c10b3c56031f41bc369fd08bc4d9d0b6916be2f0

Being able to read an adjacency matrix can give you insightful information about the graph.

For example, inspecting the previous matrix, we can realize that node number 1 has the most outgoing edges, while node number 5 has the least (actually it doesn’t have any):

https://preview.redd.it/p4kqcagv9c2b1.png?width=4350&format=png&auto=webp&s=c58ef832226a162d01bee305d0939fdc31802674

Also, we can notice how even if it doesn’t have any outgoing edge, node number 5 has the largest number of incoming edges. On the other hand, node number 1 has no incoming edges:

https://preview.redd.it/37sip89pac2b1.png?width=4350&format=png&auto=webp&s=ad3705d146a1a59036b58897f139f72c3932c62e

If the graph is weighted, the adjacency matrix representation can be extended so that the matrix contains the weight of the edge if the edge exists. Otherwise, it will contain the number 0:

https://preview.redd.it/tcehhnvuac2b1.png?width=4350&format=png&auto=webp&s=a33666da827faacc78b53632709ef3c9e8d94921

 ***Note:*** *We are choosing the number* 0 *to represent the absence of an edge because it is convenient in this case. Nevertheless, for solving some graph-related problems, this number can vary. For example,* -1 *or a very big (or small) number can be used instead.*

One of the greatest advantages of the adjacency matrix representation is that we can efficiently verify the existence of an edge. By indexing in a position \[x\]\[y\], we immediately know whether there is an edge or not between nodes x and y.

On the other hand, one of its greatest drawbacks is the fact that it requires O(n\^2) space to represent a graph with n nodes.

Let’s move forward to the last representation we’ll be exploring today!

## Adjacency List

The **adjacency list** representation is the most common way to represent graphs since most of the classic graph algorithms can be implemented very efficiently using this representation.

Every node x will be assigned a list that will contain all the nodes to which there is an edge from x.

Let’s see an example:

https://preview.redd.it/4bu3jcg7bc2b1.png?width=3666&format=png&auto=webp&s=31bc8556a5f0dcc594d6a61aafb3c588ab2a33d1

Notice how in this representation we store the exact neighbors for every node, instead of allocating space for all of the n nodes of the graph, as in the adjacency matrix representation.

Let’s take a look at node number 1 and its neighbors:

https://preview.redd.it/6arasajabc2b1.png?width=3666&format=png&auto=webp&s=f4a27e1f87ff264017755ff6f680dc9f1d0f1b51

We could store ordered pairs instead of single integers to represent weighted graphs. The pairs would be of the form (y, w), where y represents a node and w represents the weight of the edge.

Adding some weights to our previous graph:

https://preview.redd.it/rlsbnlhgbc2b1.png?width=4368&format=png&auto=webp&s=2bfbe5712624fdfeee382f82e247533b717278a1

 And once again, taking node number 1 as an example: 

https://preview.redd.it/jnmmg4iibc2b1.png?width=4368&format=png&auto=webp&s=0f7ab2112cad22d4c1a92c3e33d8857de990062e

An advantage of using adjacency lists is efficiently finding the nodes to which there is an edge from a given node.

Notice that, potentially, a graph can have O(n\^2) edges, which would result in this representation using the same amount of memory that the adjacency matrix representation uses. But this is rarely the case in most practical graph problems.

On the other hand, if we would want to check whether there is an edge between nodes x  
 and y we would have to iterate the adjacency list of x until we find node y or reach the end of the list. So, adjacency matrices take the lead here.

In future posts, we will explore algorithms for traversing graphs, finding shortest paths, or determining valid colorings.

Most of these algorithms behave very differently depending on the type of representation we use for our graphs.

75,1684967623.0,I recently derived a new line drawing function that hasn't ever been off by a few pixels and hasnt ever had gaps," 

Bresenham's line drawing algorithm always goes off by a few pixels when I implement it, so I derived my own in a similar way.

y=mx+b

y=dy/dx x + b

dx y = dy x + dx b

0 = dy x - dx y + dx b

f(m, n) = dy m - dx n + dx b

N = f(x+t, y+u), f(x,y) = 0  
N = dy(x+t) - dx(y+u) + dx b

\- 0 = dy x - dx y + dx b

N = dy t - dx u

Let u = v+1/2:  
N = dy t - dx (v+1/2)

0 > dy t - dx (v+1/2)  
dx(v+1/2) > dy t

dx (2v+1) > 2 dy t

This is the implementation that I be using as of this time.

void drawLine(int x0, int y0, int x1, int y1, rgb color) {  
int dx = abs(x1 - x0);  
int dy = abs(y1 - y0);  
int tilt = dy < dx ? -1 : 1;  
int step = tilt == -1 ? x0 < x1 ? -1 : 1 : y0 < y1 ? -1 : 1;  
int mode = tilt == -1 ? y1 < y0 ? -1 : 1 : x1 < x0 ? -1 : 1;  
int sV = tilt == -1 ? x0 > x1 ? x1 : x0 : y0 > y1 ? y1 : y0;  
int eV = tilt == -1 ? x0 > x1 ? x0 : x1 : y0 > y1 ? y0 : y1;  
int L = tilt == -1 ? dx : dy;  
int R = tilt == -1 ? dy : dx;  
for(int i = sV, h = 0, l = L, r = -R, c = tilt == -1 ? x0 > x1 ? y1 : y0 : y0 > y1 ? x1 : x0; i <= eV; i++) {  
if(l < (r += 2 \* R)) { h++; l += 2 \* L; }  
if(tilt == -1) plot(i, c - h \* step \* mode, color);  
if(tilt == 1) plot(c - h \* step \* mode, i, color);

}

}

It hasn't been tested as far as I know, so I'm not sure if changing step and mode would break the function if it were to undergo extensive use, but this is an optimization that could be done:  
int hStep = x0 < x1 ? tilt : -tilt;

int vStep = y0 < y1 ? -tilt : tilt;

&#x200B;

Since line drawing functions are easily called countless times a frame, it would probably go faster due to checking that less, but I'm not sure how messing with the first one, which be more rigorous would affect things after extensive use.",NotWhiteRice,11,0.66,3,https://www.reddit.com/r/computerscience/comments/13r032h/i_recently_derived_a_new_line_drawing_function/

77,1684934150.0,HtDP vs SICS (intro CS courses): a discussion,"Good morning all!

I would love to have a discussion on pros/cons of two of the most popular Comp-Sci intro courses I have seen in different CS/programming forums, these are SICS (Structure and Interpretation of Computer Programs) and HtDP (How to Design programs). 

Some background: I am in a fortunate situation where I took an open source web-dev bootcamp and ended up getting a job as a software dev at a place I really love. The bootcamp certainly prepared me for many of the higher level topics in web/cloud dev however, I would really like to expand my own CS education as my undergrad was in physics and I feel many intro CS topics are missing from my toolbelt.   


I have narrowed the ""start"" of my journey to the two video-curriculum-based classes mentioned above, each being pushed by their own open-source ""undergrad education tracks."" OSSU ([https://github.com/ossu/computer-science](https://github.com/ossu/computer-science)) with HtDP and teachyourselfcs ([https://teachyourselfcs.com/](https://teachyourselfcs.com/)) with SICP. I started with OSSU as they have a verbose course-load with a large community, however I've had some MAJOR issues with the HtDP course that have really made me rethink that decision and would love to have some discussion & ideas from those that may have more/other experience and hopefully also create a resource for those that have this dilemma in the future. Below are my pros/cons for each.  


HtDP  
pros:  
\- a part of the OSSU curriculum  
\- unique approach to problem-solving first & tdd  
cons:  
\- ANY course access behind a paywall (3 months) on edEx  
\- many practice problems in the course behind a paywall (there is a separate problem bank)  
\- done in a course-specific & not very popular language (racket, which is a BSL language?)  
\- pretty much requires their IDE, DrRacket, which (in my opinion) is horrible  
\- tons of graphic-based problems & projects (this con is certainly opinion based)  


ICS  
pros:  
\- multiple courses taught using the SICP book including those from MIT, Berkeley, and even more ""modern"" ones using python  
\- open to the use of multiple languages (though Scheme, a Lisp dialect, is recommended)  
\- lots of language resources  
\- can esily use your own IDE/environment  
\- no paywalls on most of the courses I've seen  
cons:  
\- older/less-modern classes  
So... these lists probably do a good job of highlighting my biases and frustrations haha, hence why I'd like to have conversations with others. I've been completely turned off of the HtDP course by their paywalls and incredibly specific language/topics - this brings back memories of undergrad professors making you buy THEIR textbook - and just gives me a bad taste in my mouth and reeks of money. Both courses have free books so you can easily self-teach/pace yourself without their video-curriculum-courses, but I'd like to have that structure in my life as I'm working a full-time job. At this point, I'm likely just going to start the SICP Berkeley course, but the beginning of the HtDP was so unique and interesting in its TDD methodology and interface work I'm honestly a bit sad to leave it behind. Using a separate IDE & environment from the one I use at work every day and learned on is just unacceptable to me and figuring out how to replicate the work in my own just isn't worth the time investment (to me). Honestly, just a bit frustrated at all of the work I've tried to put into HtDP just to have course access removed after 3 months and having to make another fake account to reset all progress combined with their community's mentality of ""oh just do it, you must not be motivated enough!"" I'm an adult in a full-time job trying to learn, so I don't always have time to finish up a course this quickly, what can I say?

78,1684856872.0,Is it possible (in theory) to do computations using wave interference?,"So, here's my question: can you do adition, subtraction, multiplication, division, (maybe even exponents and roots!) with nothing but wave interference?

&#x200B;

Basically, you have 2 photons that have the number encoded in each one. You have them interfere, then decode it. If destructive interference, it would subtract the number from it (a 10 would be twoice as much as a 5, so subtracting them would make a 5). Do the opposite, and you get a higher energy wave from those 2 merging (constructive interference), making a 15!

Could such a system work for computations? (I doubt it would be good on modern day computers, but on massive computers that are big enough that the speed difference between electrons and photons is noticible, a system of mirrors and interference could allow calculations to occur at light speed).

So, could addition and subtraction be done that way? If so, could multiplication and division be done *directly*, or would you just have to send a signal saying ""continue doing this ""x"" times"". What about exponents?

## Neighbors and Degrees

Two nodes are **neighbors** or **adjacent** if there is an edge between them. The **degree** of a node is the number of its neighbors.

In the following graph, we have highlighted a node (colored in green), its neighbors (colored in red), and the edges between them (colored in blue):

https://preview.redd.it/jvl23n8vey0b1.png?width=771&format=png&auto=webp&s=18708ac8986ca1fd7d6ef1ba33b192216fcb8725

 We can see that the green node has three incident edges and three neighbors, and therefore, it has a degree equal to 3.

In the next image, we can see the degree of every node:

https://preview.redd.it/0t39le8yey0b1.png?width=771&format=png&auto=webp&s=f16cea127a7992d600b19efa87996748e30c5d73

Something to notice is the fact that the sum of degrees in a graph is always 2m, where m is the number of edges. This happens because each edge increases the degree of exactly two nodes by one. So, the sum of the degrees is always even.

A graph is **regular** if the degree of every node is a constant d. A graph is **complete** if the degree of every node is n−1, where n is the number of nodes in the graph. That is, the graph contains all possible edges between the nodes. By definition, a complete graph is a regular graph.

Here’s an example of a regular graph that is not complete. Notice how the degree of every node is 2:

https://preview.redd.it/bwfrwpd4fy0b1.png?width=479&format=png&auto=webp&s=530ddf6f453e469d1c48e9b5cab34dcccc6acf18

And this is an example of a complete graph. Notice how the degree of every node is 3 and there are 4 nodes: 

https://preview.redd.it/ba443hp6fy0b1.png?width=479&format=png&auto=webp&s=613e6cfc34180beffb17c90f123bb955b08a7c00

When we are referring to directed graphs, we define the **indegree** of a node as the number of edges that end at the node, and the **outdegree** of a node as the number of edges that start at the node.

Here’s an example highlighting a node with an indegree equal to 2 and an outdegree equal to 1:

https://preview.redd.it/zsztfb9bfy0b1.png?width=771&format=png&auto=webp&s=f79bda1967ee721c48abb24d957b0a4214517aca

And these are the values of indegree/outdegree for every node. Notice how some nodes can have indegree or outdegree equal to 0:

https://preview.redd.it/gehnxdeefy0b1.png?width=780&format=png&auto=webp&s=862850d6cdae875c579179d484463b13dc0005d6

## Colorings

In a **coloring** of a graph, each node is assigned a color so that no adjacent nodes have the same color.

A graph is called **bipartite** if it is possible to find a coloring of its nodes using two colors. It can be proven that a graph is bipartite exactly when it does not contain a cycle with an odd number of edges.

For example, the following graph is bipartite:

https://preview.redd.it/u3ff564kiy0b1.png?width=771&format=png&auto=webp&s=f2fc3727103e4960f4f12348df9cdd73905c0ce7

 We can claim that it is bipartite because we can find a coloring of the graph using only two colors:

https://preview.redd.it/5q6tlbamiy0b1.png?width=771&format=png&auto=webp&s=a94bc6fb6e332cbf339c94e1718aab36831641f5

And here’s a more intuitive way to visualize bipartite graphs. The previous and the following graphs are the same: 

https://preview.redd.it/323j7qmoiy0b1.png?width=604&format=png&auto=webp&s=f5d2fda73372482f91636d8ed28b4511c72800c8

With this representation, it becomes visually more clear that the nodes can be split into two sets, and that every edge in the graph connects nodes from different sets.

Now, let’s take a look at the following graph:

https://preview.redd.it/zw1ejb3riy0b1.png?width=771&format=png&auto=webp&s=9b2327d0cc3a220489b0b45add7e217cf5cf5a08

No matter how hard you try, you won’t be able to find a coloring of this graph using only two colors. Remember earlier, when we said that cycles of odd length and bipartiteness are related?

Inspecting the graph closely, we can notice that it contains a cycle of length 3. It won’t be possible to color this cycle (or the entire graph) using only two colors:

https://preview.redd.it/32fw886tiy0b1.png?width=771&format=png&auto=webp&s=03f2155022d4c1eb696d067ab4abba305c15283a

In future posts, we will explore algorithms to determine if a graph is bipartite or not.

* Challenges of cloud abstractions.
* Importance of tools like stack traces for debugging, especially in distributed systems.

Gregor emphasizes that effective cloud abstractions are crucial but tricky to get right. He points out that debugging at the abstraction level can be complex and underscores the value of good error messages and observability. 

The part about the ""unhappy path"" particularly resonated with me: 

>The unhappy path is where many abstractions struggle. Software that makes building small systems easy but struggles with real-world development scenarios like debugging or automated testing is an unwelcome version of “demoware” - it demos well, but doesn’t actually work in the real world. And there’s no unlock code. ... I propose the following test for vendors demoing higher-level development systems:  
>  
>1. Ask them to enter a typo into one of the fields where the developer is expected to enter some logic.  
>  
>2. Ask them to leave the room for two minutes while we change a few random elements of their demo configuration. Upon return, they would have to debug and figure out what was changed.

I'm one of the creators of [Winglang](https://github.com/winglang/wing), an open-source programming language for the cloud that allows developers to work at a higher level of abstraction.

[Algorithmically Speaking - #3: Nodes, Edges, and Connectivity](https://albexl.substack.com/p/introduction-to-graph-theory)

Let’s begin!

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

## Nodes, Edges, and Paths

A **graph** consists of **nodes** and **edges**. We could see the nodes as the fundamental entities of graphs, and edges represent the relationships between nodes.

One good thing about graphs is that, even if they represent an abstract mathematical definition, we can visually display them using the most simple drawings of circles and lines.

Here’s a hand-drawn image of a graph with 5 nodes and 7 edges that we will we use to help us understand some basic definitions:

https://preview.redd.it/0a1y8llz8kza1.png?width=771&format=png&auto=webp&s=e13eb20bb4d163185d0b754ce8a619c2c6abd44a

A **path** leads from node **a** to node **b** through the edges of the graph. The length of a path is the number of edges in it.

The highlighted (red) path between the two green nodes in the following image is of length 3:

https://preview.redd.it/a36yrzy09kza1.png?width=771&format=png&auto=webp&s=dc22c26073857a8d5a773e081e7929af429c67f3

>***Note****: The highlighted path is just one of the possible paths between the two green nodes. Try to identify every possible path between them.*

A path is a **cycle** if the first and last node is the same. On the other hand, a path is called **simple** if each node appears at most once in the path.

The highlighted path in the previous image corresponds to a simple path, while the one in the following image is considered a cycle:

https://preview.redd.it/hpnn0bz39kza1.png?width=771&format=png&auto=webp&s=c981d45b507ec9cddf18e3dbd1f445da167b9ff3

## Connectivity

A graph is **connected** if there is a path between any two nodes. For example, our initial graph is connected:

https://preview.redd.it/aldp6s2o9kza1.png?width=771&format=png&auto=webp&s=315fd6168db76955c5f7469e63246228dd829857

>***Try it yourself****: take any pair of nodes in the previous graph and check that, indeed, there is a path between them.*

On the other hand, the following graph is **not connected** because there is no path between the highlighted nodes:

https://preview.redd.it/u1wp2s2lakza1.png?width=1012&format=png&auto=webp&s=7684d57bebc41f14bfaf7b48cb67bb0284610563

In fact, there is no path between any node located in the right-bottom corner and any node located in the left-top corner.

The sets of connected nodes in a graph are called **connected components**. Here are the connected components (nodes with the same color) of the previous graph:

https://preview.redd.it/h049y5nnakza1.png?width=1296&format=png&auto=webp&s=2e0495b2e55586068ba40a158dcd11fcbf9ccbd8

We can clearly see that this graph has two connected components.

A **tree** is a connected graph that consists of **n** nodes and **n−1** edges. There is a unique path between any two nodes of a tree. You can also think of a tree as a connected graph that doesn’t contain any cycles.

The following graph is a tree:

https://preview.redd.it/b29o042rakza1.png?width=771&format=png&auto=webp&s=2158bdac8f4013ed1f327e7a8129dc111dae5171

>***Try it yourself****: take any pair of nodes in the previous graph and check that, indeed, there is a* ***unique*** *path between them.*

## Direction and Weights

A graph is **directed** if the edges can be traversed in one direction only. For example, the following graph is directed:

https://preview.redd.it/qduyg4btakza1.png?width=771&format=png&auto=webp&s=8bbd5eecbd306c9b5e207feab5fea676ed1bfc9c

Notice how in the following image there is a path (more than one actually) between the green node and the blue node, but the opposite is not true. You cannot find any path starting in the blue node and ending in the green one:

https://preview.redd.it/x04bpvlkckza1.png?width=771&format=png&auto=webp&s=a5a8f97b1f4d4e3610ce17aa6433008f7eeb7dd6

As we can see, the fact the graph is directed affects the concept of connectivity, which is called **strong connectivity** when we are referring to directed graphs. We will learn more about this in future posts.

In a **weighted** graph, each edge is assigned a **weight**. The weights are often interpreted as edge lengths.

The following graph is weighted:

https://preview.redd.it/convruznckza1.png?width=771&format=png&auto=webp&s=9b29d6107bf86ae4ecbf305c3602d1f01e609ece

The length of a path in a weighted graph is the **sum** of the edge weights on the path. For example, in the following graph, the length of the highlighted path between the green nodes is 13 (8 + 5):

https://preview.redd.it/orcc39orckza1.png?width=771&format=png&auto=webp&s=18e069b59160b40f18f94ae7037b4f5d44cb1779

One of the earliest uses of random numbers was in the Monte Carlo method, a computational technique for simulating random processes that was first developed by scientists working on the Manhattan Project in the 1940s.The first algorithm for generating random numbers on a computer was developed by John von Neumann and his colleagues in the late 1940s.

We have come a long way in the generation of random number from the time it was first discovered the most common one are ""Pseudo Random Number Generators""(PRNGs)

&#x200B;

>Pseudo-random number generators (PRNGs) use a deterministic algorithm to generate a sequence of numbers that appear random, but the sequence is actually predetermined by the algorithm and an initial seed value. If the seed value is known, the sequence of numbers can be reproduced.

Although it is significantly better but not quite for some application because of that, some computer systems use physical phenomena such as atmospheric noise, radioactive decay, or thermal noise as sources of entropy. These sources of randomness are used to generate a seed value for a PRNGs, which can then be used to produce a sequence of pseudo-random numbers. This combination of true randomness and pseudo-randomness can provide a high degree of randomness for many applications.

&#x200B;

>Over the time different techniques were developed to satisfy the need of true randomness (close to it).

&#x200B;

1. **Physical sources of randomness:** These methods use physical phenomena to generate random numbers, such as radioactive decay, thermal noise, or atmospheric noise. For example, a hardware random number generator (HRNG) can be used to sample physical processes and generate truly random numbers. HRNGs can be expensive and require specialized hardware, but they provide a high degree of randomness.
2. **Pseudo-random number generators with unpredictable seeds:** These methods use pseudo-random number generators, but with unpredictable seed values. The seed values can be generated from sources of randomness, such as mouse movements or keyboard timings. This approach can be less expensive and more accessible than using physical sources of randomness, but it can still be vulnerable to attacks if the seed values are not truly random.
3. **Internet-based randomness services:** These methods use random data from network sources, such as atmospheric noise or radio noise, to generate random numbers. This approach can be convenient and accessible, but it can also be vulnerable to network-based attacks.
4. **Quantum random number generators:** These methods use quantum phenomena, such as the polarization of light or the measurement of quantum states, to generate truly random numbers. Quantum random number generators (QRNGs) provide the highest level of randomness and security, but they can be expensive and require specialized hardware.

&#x200B;

>QRNGs or HRNGs are majorly used in cryptographic applications.

So why it is so hard to generate a true random number , the thing is all the methods discussed earlier all depends on some source/seed to generate random number which is not idle for generating a true random number as a true random number is unbiased and not based on any pattern. There are some researchers that are trying to improve the randomness of random number with the help of AI and machine learning but still it's a long way to achieve a true random number. Some researchers suggested that a true random number is beyond the realm of computer science and it is a problem of quantum physics.",,0,0.32,25,https://www.reddit.com/r/computerscience/comments/13ffyc6/true_random_number_is_still_a_myth/

You will soon realize that this function takes too long for some cases because it is calculating the answer for the same input values multiple times.

Then is when you add Memoization:

 If Memoization still feels like a hack for you, then you can try to rewrite the recursive function as an iterative function. This is often hard to do, but it is a recommended exercise if you want to test your understanding of the problem you are trying to solve.

126,1683215314.0,Hello Everyone!!! Logging - file v async message to db,"Hello everyone, I am working on modernizing my views on some architectural design patterns and am currently doing a fair amount of lambda and sqs work for context and need some additional thoughts and opinions.

I image most folks are are familiar with how applications generally log to a file and this is many times the default approach. It's fast, it has a reasonably small size, and if you want to get advanced with it you can import that file into a log processor to get metrics and do more advanced searches and such. In my case these currently end up in AWS CloudWatch and I am seriously not happy with Amazons solution for this. I find it very challenging to find groupings of log lines together that I would expect to be grouped together and IMO the ability to search through cloud watch is almost non existent. (if someone has a writeup to prove me wrong or show me a better way to use CloudWatch I welcome it)

One solutions I have seen to solve some of these log search problems is to log to a DB (about 12 years ago) but I recognize this is not a great solution due to the relative expense of the DB call (ie will probably cause some performance degradation to the application)

What I am thinking about and want other thoughts on, is if you are going all in on modern architecture, messaging, lambdas (or similar) is there any good reason to not log via message? 

In example I have an event I want to log from my lambda application and rather than logging out in a traditional way I send a message to a queue that is then picked up and processed by a logging application to a DB.

What downsides could occur using this style of architecture?

This is what I think I see ...

Pros:

* Solves the expensive DB write call
* Decouples the logging process from the primary application
* By storing the logs in a db makes them much much more searchable for issues, auditing, and the like

Cons:

* Mentally its more complex, at least at the beginning
* May not mean you do not have logging in your app as you still need a way to get info out during local development

So to everyone here what are your thoughts? What am I missing or not thinking about? Is there some great solution out there that would solve this without manual work that I dont know about? Costs associated with the solution v what I am suggesting?

127,1683143476.0,What is the link between the halting problem and the Universal Turing Machine?," 

A lot of the lectures when introducing the halting problem show the universal Turing machine right before the halting problem. However, I feel like they fail to show the connection (or maybe I just cannot see it and it's only my fault). I  would be really grateful if you can provide me with some mental bridge to help me connect these concepts.

Universal TM is a machine that can simulate any other TM. It should output the same output as the ""inner"" TM itself.

A halting problem can be shown by a function or algorithm that contradicts itself.

    def g():         
        if halts(g):         
            loop_forever() 

Is the connection here just that thanks to the existence of the UTM, we can simulate one machine inside of another and let the outer TM contradict the inner TM and then generalize this for all TM thanks to UTM? However, shouldn't the UTM  provide equal output to the inner TM? Or there is more to it? I feel like I'm getting lost when seeing all of this ""fancy language"" of university lectures.

I also can understand this explanation, however, I'm not sure whether it is correct or not:

 If there was an algorithm that could solve the halting problem for all possible Turing machines, then we could use that algorithm to decide whether the Universal Turing Machine halts or not on a given input,  which we know to be impossible.  
In other words, the Universal Turing Machine can simulate any other Turing machine, including one that solves the halting problem, but it cannot solve the halting problem for itself.",patmull,0,0.5,6,https://www.reddit.com/r/computerscience/comments/136xihg/what_is_the_link_between_the_halting_problem_and/

I know that this can be a tricky and intimidating topic, so I've done my best to break everything down and make it as accessible as possible. If you're new to the field, struggling with some of these concepts, or if you just need a refresher, this is for you.

# An Introduction to Algorithms, Pt. 4: The TSP and Heuristics

Have you ever wondered how long it would take to visit every city in the world? Or how to plan a road trip that minimizes travel time and cost? Perhaps you're curious about how biologists sequence DNA molecules containing millions of base pairs. These optimization challenges are all related to a classic problem in computer science known as the **Traveling Salesperson Problem (TSP)**. Traditionally, it asks: *given a list of cities and the distances between each pair, what is the shortest possible route that visits each city exactly once and returns to the starting point?* Answering this question is not easy. In fact, the TSP belongs to a select subset of problems classified as NP-hard because there is no known algorithm that can optimally solve any and every instance of them in reasonable (a.k.a., ""polynomial"") time.

It is one of the most intensively studied problems in optimization, and it has many practical applications in planning, logistics, manufacturing, biology, and astronomy. In your academic and professional career, you will encounter several common variations.

**First, a given instance of the problem can be symmetric or asymmetric**. In a symmetric TSP, the distance between two cities is the same in both directions, meaning that the cost of traveling from city A to city B is the same as traveling from city B to city A. In asymmetric instances of the TSP, the distance between two cities varies depending on the direction of travel -- potentially due to one-way streets, traffic conditions, or different modes of transportation. **Another way to classify TSPs is by their completeness**. A complete TSP has a direct route between every pair of cities, so you can travel between any two without stopping. On the other hand, an incomplete TSP has some missing routes between cities, possibly because of physical barriers, such as mountains or oceans. Each variation presents a unique challenge that affects the algorithms and heuristics required to find an efficient solution.

Now that you're familiar with the TSP, it's time to explore some tangible examples designed to illustrate the problem and solidify your understanding.

**TSP Example #1: Symmetric, Complete with Four Cities**

https://preview.redd.it/6fqpwnai7nwa1.png?width=600&format=png&auto=webp&s=fd0a0ed023a7f300355d23afb818f49c78acaa5e

We will start with a symmetric, complete TSP involving four cities: A, B, C, and D. In this instance, the distances between cities are the same in both directions, and there is a direct route between every pair of cities.

[A Symmetric, Complete TSP \(not to scale\)](https://preview.redd.it/ahmb4j1o7nwa1.png?width=600&format=png&auto=webp&s=5380cf6487e2798d7e4676ccf1e54891a5a19f1e)

Given the limited nature of this TSP, we can determine the optimal solution using **a brute-force approach**. In the brute-force approach, you identify every possible route that visits each city. Calculate the total distance for each one. Then, choose the shortest. This approach is guaranteed to produce the optimal solution, but it comes at a high computational cost because the number of possible routes increases factorially with the number of cities.

In our four-city example, there are only six possible routes. However, in instances of the TSP involving ten cities, that number skyrockets to 362,880. And for problems involving a mere 20 cities, there are 121,645,100,408,832,000 possible routes. To put these numbers into perspective, even with a computer capable of evaluating one route every millisecond, it would still require over 3.8 million years to check every possible route in a 20-city TSP. That is shocking, and it highlights the limitations of a brute-force approach.

Nevertheless, it remains a valuable tool for understanding the TSP and establishing a foundation for more efficient algorithms. A brute-force approach is also appropriate for solving relatively small TSP instances. So, without further ado, here is a visual depiction of the solution to our first example:

[Visualizing a Brute Force Approach](https://preview.redd.it/1p7lcqrz7nwa1.png?width=600&format=png&auto=webp&s=58b82f046e067c76912a203dd89a2d03a7df9da6)

As you can see, six distinct routes take you from a given city (in this case, city “A”) to all other cities, and back to your city of origin. Now, let’s calculate the total distance required to traverse each one of these routes to determine the optimal solution.

[Calculating the Total Distance](https://preview.redd.it/cxxjd2v28nwa1.png?width=600&format=png&auto=webp&s=8a6339f31f25a3093bccb654957376024c87aef5)

The optimal solution is the tour A-B-C-D-A, or its reverse A-D-C-B-A, with a total distance of 152 km. In symmetric, complete instances of the TSP, there are always two identical, optimal solutions because the distance between two cities remains the same regardless of the direction of travel. Next, you will evaluate an asymmetric, incomplete instance of the TSP and solve it with brute-force methods.

**TSP Example #2: Asymmetric, Incomplete with Four Cities**

https://preview.redd.it/4p3l7al88nwa1.png?width=600&format=png&auto=webp&s=02a9a882bccc8b65675608582c050b15a111abe8

As promised, an asymmetric, incomplete TSP involving four cities: W, X, Y, and Z. In this instance, the distance between cities varies depending on your direction of travel, and there is no direct route between city Y and city Z.

[An Asymmetric, Incomplete TSP \(not to scale\)](https://preview.redd.it/ahegkleb8nwa1.png?width=600&format=png&auto=webp&s=728b0700788d1ae335a49339a5e8337419969a4e)

To account for the lack of a direct route from city Y to city Z, we will approach this TSP in a non-traditional manner that allows for revisiting cities. This example highlights the complexities of real-world instances of the TSP and the limitations of its traditional rules.

Try to find the optimal route using a brute-force approach before reading my solution, and embrace this opportunity to solve a practical, tricky instance of the TSP that requires you to think outside the box. Remember, the shortest route might involve retracing your steps to ensure all cities are in the tour.

If you’re not sure where to start, answer the question: *What is the fastest way to get from city Y to city Z and vice versa?*

After you have tried to solve this problem, read my solution and compare your approach to mine. Answer the following questions as you evaluate your solution:

1. Did you find the shortest route?
2. What challenges did you face while solving this problem?
3. What did you learn from this exercise?
4. How difficult would it be to apply this brute-force approach to an instance with five or six cities?

Answering these will help you to gain a deeper understanding of the TSP and its many variations.

Good luck.

Do not read on until you’re ready to compare my solution with yours. This exercise will help you learn and become a more proficient problem-solver.

[A Partial Visualization of the Brute Force Approach](https://preview.redd.it/k0svpvgecnwa1.png?width=600&format=png&auto=webp&s=3d04be94835c08d4ebd64b8d9fe9534bb6e71833)

As a starting point, you may have selected city “W” and identified unique routes that limit the need to revisit cities. If so, you produced a series of routes similar to the ones depicted above. This approach is reasonable, and if you went on to calculate the total distance of each one of these six routes, you would have produced a table like this:

[Calculating the Total Distance](https://preview.redd.it/vdbpx6azwqeb1.png?width=640&format=png&auto=webp&s=7063b14b3dd1d01deec0053d5de35f037dfe8530)

If you stopped there, you might be thinking that the optimal solution is the route W-X-Y-X-Z-W, which has a total distance of 105 km. But, you would be wrong. The most efficient routes can be found by treating city “X” as a fulcrum and revisiting it after every stop, which would lead you to something like **X-W-X-Y-X-Z-X**. One of the truly optimal routes, which has a **total distance of 100 km**. 

**TSP Example #3: A European Tour with 12 Countries**

In our third and final example, we have a larger symmetric, complete TSP that involves 12 countries.

[This table shows the approximate distances \(in kilometers\) between 12 European countries that form a symmetric and complete instance of the TSP.](https://preview.redd.it/9vh00h9tcnwa1.png?width=600&format=png&auto=webp&s=0df7aed11a5da4b42a7d9beb2eba8c8af3390f55)

https://preview.redd.it/o3izwvvzcnwa1.png?width=600&format=png&auto=webp&s=87a89d3d511da90ec77490d3d0938641b5d776ef

It is unreasonable to apply brute-force methods to this example. There are 39,916,800 unique routes, and even if we took its symmetric nature into account and cut that number in half… 19,958,400 remain. But wait, what if we had a powerful computer capable of evaluating one route every millisecond? It would still take \~5.5 hours to determine the optimal solution. That is unacceptable.

Fortunately, we can leverage the power of **heuristics** when we encounter problems like this. Heuristics are problem-solving techniques that use shortcuts, rules of thumb, or practical approaches to find approximate or “good-enough” solutions to complex problems more quickly and efficiently than exhaustive methods. They prioritize speed and simplicity over optimality and often trade a guaranteed, best solution for one that is close enough or satisfactory, especially when dealing with computationally expensive problems. They are invaluable.

One popular heuristic for the TSP is **the nearest neighbor** algorithm: 

1. Start at a city (the current city).
2. Mark the current city as visited.
3. Find the unvisited city nearest to the current city.
4. If there are no unvisited cities left, go back to the starting city and terminate the algorithm. Otherwise, set the nearest unvisited city as the current city and return to step 2.

The nearest neighbor algorithm is a greedy heuristic, which means that it makes the best local choice at each step. Of course, this series of locally optimal decisions does not guarantee that the final solution will be optimal or even close to optimal. Sometimes it overlooks shorter routes because they involve visiting cities that are not the nearest neighbors at some point. Its primary advantage is that it is easy to implement and execute quickly. 

Two key variables affect the quality of the solution produced by the nearest neighbor algorithm: (1) the choice of starting city and (2) the distribution of distances between cities. We will focus on the choice of starting city because it’s a variable we control. While there is no definitive method for selecting the perfect starting city, there are some popular strategies worth considering: 

1. Start with a random city, execute the algorithm multiple times, and choose the best solution from the results.
2. Choose a city close to the geometric center of all the cities.
3. Select the city that has the smallest average distance to all other cities.

Experimenting with these strategies can help you optimize the nearest neighbor algorithm’s performance and generate higher-quality solutions.

Now it’s time to apply this heuristic to our 12-Country European Tour. If we naively choose city A, Portugal, as our starting city, we will visit countries F, K, H, J, C, L, E, I, D, G, and B in order of their proximity to one another, using the distance data provided. After we visit every country, we will return to Portugal to complete the tour. This naïve route requires us to travel a total distance of 16,000 km.

What if we choose a more strategic starting point, a country close to the geometric center of this TSP, a country like Germany? By beginning our tour in Germany, country I, we will travel to countries K, H, J, C, L, E, B, G, D, F, A, and then back to I. This route only requires us to travel 12,900 km — 3,100 km less than our naïve route. A notable improvement!

As you can see, the choice of starting city can significantly impact the efficiency of the nearest neighbor algorithm. Remember this, and do not hesitate to experiment with different strategies in an effort to optimize your solution.

**Conclusion**

The Traveling Salesperson Problem is a fascinating and complex optimization problem that has captivated the minds of many brilliant mathematicians and computer scientists. Its widespread applications in planning, logistics, manufacturing, biology, and astronomy make it an essential problem to study and understand.

Throughout this article, we explored the limitations of brute-force methods and the power of heuristics like the nearest neighbor algorithm, but the truth is that there is so, so much more for you to learn. As you continue to study computer science, you will encounter other heuristics (e.g., insertion algorithms) to help you more effectively solve the TSP and other complex, intriguing problems. Whatever you do, never stop learning, and remember that sometimes the most elegant solutions are the ones that prioritize simplicity and practicality.",Darkside7Legend,77,0.98,3,https://www.reddit.com/r/computerscience/comments/131yw2k/an_introduction_to_algorithms_pt_4_the_tsp_and/

147,1682642867.0,Resources for understanding parallel computing models in distributed systems,"Hi everyone,

I'm currently working on a project that involves building a ""parallel executor"", which is a piece of software that takes a ""remote computation"" object and effectively parallelizes it across a distributed pool of computers.

To accomplish this, I need to gain a deeper understanding of parallel computing models and abstractions used in building distributed systems. Specifically, I'm interested in learning about the parallel computing model used in building such executor, and how it can be applied to breaking down tasks into smaller ones and executing them in parallel across multiple computers. This also will help me build the core abstractions to represent a ""remote computation"". I would also appreciate any other relevant resources that may help me gain a better understanding of parallel computing.

My ultimate goal is to build an automatic distributed parallelization system that can handle remote computation objects and effectively break them down into smaller tasks and execute them in parallel across multiple computers.

151,1682556190.0,C Memory Safety And It's Consequences In Safety-Critical Applications,"Hi all!  


I'm a first year engineering student and was doing some digging about C out of my own interest. I saw a lot of mention about C being an unsafe language due to the potential to exploit memory vulnerabilities. From what I understand, you could do a lot of different things to compromise systems by exploiting Buffer Overflows/Stack smashing, or abusing mistakes such as Use-After-Free pointers or Dangling pointers, or taking control of uninitialized pointers to run code of an attacker's choice.

Now, C is a low level language used a lot on different embedded systems because of it's great low-level control and speed. It's also heavily used in safety-critical applications such as Flight Control Systems, Life Support Units, Autonomous Driving Systems, and things of this nature which led to my questions:  


1) How do developers working on safety-critical applications ensure their systems are not vulnerable to memory-related exploits?  
2) What strategies and practices can developers follow to write safe and secure C code for these critical applications?  
3) Despite the existence of memory-safe languages like Rust, why has C remained the preferred choice for a lot of these safety-critical applications over 50 years since its creation?

165,1682280122.0,AI Predictions for CPU Scheduling?,"Hi everyone!

I am currently doing my Bachelor's in CS and I'm looking at OS right now. I had a thought to share and hopefully get some answers from people more experienced than me in this sub.

I was looking at CPU schedulers and how the Shortest Job First policy is the provably best policy to implement when minimizing average waiting time, but how this is limited by the fact that predicting the amount of CPU time a process has left is essentially impossible. This concept of predicting future performance is also already employed in Multilevel Feedback Queues from what I understand.

I am sure someone has thought of this before, but would it be possible to use a machine-learning model to try to better predict the time that commonly executed processes take?

For example, you can have a model continually running as part of the OS which learns the user's habits and what programs they are likey to use at any given time, or you could have it learn which programs are used and how long they usually take. We could then use these predictions in creating a better scheduling policy.

I imagine the overhead for doing this right now is absolutely too large for a modern OS, but could something like this be feasable in the future? Have people already thought to do this?

I'm currently a college student and I've been wondering about the effectiveness of college education in preparing students for their future careers. Specifically, I'm curious about whether college prepares students to become researchers or software engineers (or any industry role), and whether the focus on academia is hindering their preparation for industry jobs.

It's no secret that college places a heavy emphasis on academia, with many courses and majors geared towards preparing students for a career in research. However, the reality is that a very small percentage of students actually end up in academia. So, my question is, does college adequately prepare students for industry jobs in software engineering?

In the 80s and 90s programmers knew how to do a lot of complex operations and code optimisations all by themselves, I think this is because basically all commercial software was made in assembly/C, and even BASIC was very intertwined with the hardware.


Now it seems that people don't know anything about the computer, if you ask someone which integer comparison or mathematical operation is more efficient, they're clueless.

For instance, I see when programmers are making code that loops a number of times they'll typically write:
int i = 0;
for (i = 0; i < 100; i++) {
    printer(""Print 100 times"");
}

Very few seem to know that comparison to 0 is way faster than numerical comparison on most CPUs.

Of course micro-optimisations like these are less important now because of compilers optimising, and the rest of the inneficieny being irrelevant on fast computers, but it still amazes me how little programmers know about their hardware.

184,1681771636.0,The Collatz conjecture and the definition of algorithmic undecidability,"I came across the Collatz conjecture a while ago and it has led me to another question, having read this conversation on Stack Exchange: [https://math.stackexchange.com/questions/1156004/how-could-the-collatz-conjecture-possibly-be-undecidable](https://math.stackexchange.com/questions/1156004/how-could-the-collatz-conjecture-possibly-be-undecidable) .  My understanding of decision problems is that for a finite length input, an algorithm tries to decide if it's a member of a particular set or not.  If there exists an algorithm that for every possible finite length input can correctly decide whether it's a member of this set within finite time, the problem is decidable.  Undecidable problems are those where it's either not possible to always get the correct answer, or the time complexity to do so can diverge to infinity for finite length inputs.

If we take the original Collatz function (i.e. the 3x + 1 or x / 2 rules) and the decision problem is to determine if any particular integer converges to 1, my contention is that we don't currently know if this is decidable or not.  There appear to be four possible situations depending on whether the Collatz conjecture has been proved or disproved within mathematical logic.

1. The Collatz conjecture hasn't been proved or disproved (as it currently is).  In this case there could be finite length inputs that take infinite time to determine they diverge to infinity (i.e. it's undecidable).
2. The conjecture has been proved.  In this case we would know that every finite length input must either converge to 1 or be found to be part of a finite length loop within finite time (i.e. it's decidable)
3. The conjecture has been disproved but only by showing that finite length loops exist.  In this case there could still be finite length inputs that take infinite time to determine they diverge to infinity (i.e. it's undecidable).
4. The conjecture has been disproved in a way that includes showing some integers must diverge to infinity.  In this case we know there are finite length inputs that take infinite time to diverge to infinity (i.e. it's undecidable).

My question is if the above reasoning is valid, showing that there are some decision problems that we can formulate but not yet know if they're decidable because it depends on an answer from mathematical logic.

189,1681636747.0,Is it True that Computers can only work Linearly?,"I've been thinking about this for a while now, and I reckon that computers work in a linear fashion at their core. Although some of the techniques we use might appear non-linear to us humans, computers are built to process instructions one after the other in a sequence, which is essentially just a linear process.

Is it correct to say that computers can only operate linearly? *edit: many redditors suggested that ""sequentially"" is a better word*

Also, I'm interested to hear your thoughts on quantum computing. How does it fit into this discussion? Can quantum computing break the linear nature of computers, or is it still fundamentally a linear process?

# edit:

Thanks for the answers. Most of them suggest parallelism but I guess that is not the answer I am looking for. I am sorry, I realize I am using an unclear language. Parallel execution simply involves multiple linear processes being executed simultaneously, but individual CPU cores still do it in a linear fashion.

To illustrate what I mean, take the non-linear nature of the brain's information processing. Consider the task of recognizing a familiar person. When someone approaches us, our brain processes a *wide range of inputs at once*, such as the person's facial shape, color, and texture, as well as their voice, and even unconscious inputs like scent. Our brain integrates this information at once using a complex interconnectedness of a network, forming a coherent representation of the person and retrieving their name from memory.

A computer would have to read these inputs from different sensors separately and process them sequentially (whether in parallel or not) to deliver the result. Or wouldn't?

As AI development is increasing, the gap between using technology and understanding it and taking a part in its development is growing. At the same time, there has not yet been a path established, which leads into computer science in many areas of lives but especially pop culture. For engineering you have Star Trek, Minecraft, etc. For Chess you have Queens Gambit. Why isn't there something like that for computer science? Now, that it would be needed that as many people as possible have a critical but also knowledge-based look on technology.

But, if these parts drift even more apart than they already are - user interfaces disappear more and more, the interaction with technology gets more convenient, but also more obscure and abstracted, we have a situation, in which only a few people have power over the narrative of technology and they will inevitably use that power for their advantage, resulting in a technocracy.

To prevent this, I think we need to establish a path into computer science. Something, in which everybody has a gut feeling, that if you follow that, you reach actual knowledge about or at least get closer to it somehow. The same that this has been established for playing with LEGO and reading Jules Verne for engineering. Or playing Chess for Math.

I have the theory, that such a path would develop in the next few years. After all, the digital revolution is not yet that old and it has reached the mainstream only about 15 years ago with the iPhone, so society hadn't had the time to establish these things. Thing is - generative AI is making so tremendous advancements that it might be necessary to get there quicker than usual, to take a shortcut or to end up in a bad future.

I just wondered about how it could be that Turings (complete) abstraction of a computer could be immediately realized for practical use in the physical world.

Because as I understand it, the Turing Machine is a purely mathematical construct, trying to capture what an symbolic algorithmic process is.

212,1681049684.0,Partitions growing in opposite directions?,"I have this idea for a partitioning scheme that would be quite useful for me. It seems very obvious(?), so I feel it's not done due to hardware-level details and long-ingrained characteristics of file systems.

https://preview.redd.it/dztm57dz9vsa1.png?width=1549&format=png&auto=webp&s=563cbce0e2cd114c6a89b2b30fa3ef3e02d074c5

It's quite simple: we would have partitions on opposite sides of the disk that can grow in opposite directions. This would allow us to grow them independently without the need to move partitions.

My question is: if this is not feasible, why exactly?

I understand that HDDs should not be read in arbitrary ways due to the limitations of head movement (I estimate reading blocks/pages from right to left would take \~2x head movement time). SSDs also have different read/write speeds for random vs sequential access, but I can't see how reading entire pages/blocks in arbitrary positions would be a  problem. If this is right, this scheme should have been feasible on SSDs.

OS kernels, in theory, should be able to translate the address space of an ""inverted"" partition so they can be used at the file system/software level transparently.

I know that volume managers and such solve this problem, so there's not a big demand for this kind of solution, but I am particularly curious about hypothetical solutions that would be OS-independent.

Say there are 5 acceptors: A1-5 and 2 proposers: P1 and P2. How would the Paxos algorithm work in the following situation?

1. P1 prepares ID = 245 to A1, A2, A3
2. A1, A2, A3 promise for ID = 245
3. P1 receives a majority for ID = 245
4. P2 prepares ID = 999 to A3, A4, A5
5. A3, A4, A5 promise for ID = 999
6. P1 sends propose of value V1 to A1, A2, A3
   1. A1 and A2 accept a value of V1
   2. A3 message is delayed
7. P2 send propose of value V2 to A3, A4, A5
8. A3 and A4 accept a value of V2

Now A3 will always commit to V2 since even if P1's message reaches earlier, it's ID has been committed to P2's ID.

How do you store terabytes of imagery (remote sensing data in general, such as LiDAR, hyperspectral, etc.) in a file system?

How do you manage the file system?

Once example would be the CIFAR dataset, which is a dataset that consists of millions of images.

**My assumption** would be to organize imagery in folders and sub folders. Then extract meta data for each image file (dimensions, crs, data type, etc.) and save that *with the file path* into a table in Postgres. This table could then be used for advanced querying of data (filter for data in date range, spatial filtering, etc.).

I would appreciate it if someone could describe the steps involved ! 

Btw, I asked this question before and never really got a straight answer. I want to start with the basics of pure image management in file system (like CIFAR image dataset). STAC and COG is another discussion. Please don’t recommend to store images in RDBMS 🤣.

from the viewpoint of statistics: dice fall perfectly randomly with a probability of 1/6 for each face: nondeterministic.

249,1680027216.0,Dynamic Programming - Recursion Trees to DP Tables,"So I'm learning dynamic programming and I've found recursion trees to be intuitive in encoding decisions. For example, in the problem Target Sum, where you can choose to either subtract or add the number that you're currently on, a recursion tree is an elegant way to visualize that decision at every element in the array.


However, with regard to this problem, I'm unable to see how a dp table can encode these decisions. With a recursion tree, each decision is an edge resulting in a new node. It seems to me that this Target Sum problem would require (unless there's a trick I'm unaware of to collapse these dimensions), a 2D dp table because there's a decision you're going to make (adding or subtracting the element).


Here's the problem I'm currently looking at: https://leetcode.com/problems/target-sum/


So I have two questions:

1. Is there a general way to relate these recursion trees to dp tables?
2: How are decisions captured in dp tables, for example, how would a 2D dp table for Target Sum encode the decision for subtracting or adding a number.

I am trying to implement a Q-learning pricing algorithm that can take a price from another company and from this price set the optimal price to maximize it's profit. Right now it works fine for two companies, but after implementing it for three companies, the companies stopped setting the most optimal price and start to collaborate at a sub-optimal price. The implementations can be seen in the pictures. I simply just added an extra dimension to the Q-matrix, and add an extra price vector and state to compensate for the new company. I this too naive an approach? Is there any guidance out there on how to expand a Q-function to more dimensions?

266,1679338060.0,do you know any systems that can handle multimodal data fusion and representation learning?,"So right now I’m working on a Youtube clone without ads (and in the works is a Netflix clone all without the ads) so it’s about creating a recommender system where it can suggest things to users based on what they like and what they need.

So for example, I want to recommend a video or a movie or tv show or basically videos based on not only the user’s ratings and reviews, but also their browsing history, social media activity, facial expressions, voice tone, etc. Basically, I want to create a recommender system that can predict and know what you want to watch before you do. 

Well maybe you’d have to start off somewhere, watch a few videos here and there, create some initial searches and then based on those searches, it can start to predict what you want, what you really really want but not to the point where it’s similar to Youtube’s algorithm that it starts recommending random crap that you didn’t even search for.

Thing is, well, this is kind of also very challenging. I’m having trouble finding relevant datasets, models and frameworks that can handle such complex and diverse data sources. Most of the existing recommender systems are either based on collaborative filtering or content-based filtering, which are limited by data sparsity and cold start problems. I need something more advanced and robust that can handle multimodal data fusion and representation learning.

I'm most likely wrong and never realized until recently. Now I'm considering buying books (physical copy to give them a fair chance, PDFs are so impractical) .

How do you feel about learning via books versus via courses? Do you feel like books allow to go deeper and get a better understanding at the cost of requiring more motivation (no one to hold your hand and walk you through it)?

316,1663308240.0,Computer Science is hard.,"I see lots of posts here with people asking for advice about learning cs and coding with incredibly unrealistic expectations. People who will say ""I've been studying cs for 2 months and I don't get Turing machines yet"", or things like that.

People, computer science is Hard! There are lots of people that claim you can learn enough in a 4 month crash course to get a job, and for some people that is true, but for most of us, getting anywhere in this field takes years.

How does [the internet, Linux, compilers, blockchain, neutral nets, design patterns, Turing machines, etc] work? These are complicated things made out of other complicated things made out of complicated things. Understanding them takes years of tedious study and understanding.

There's already so much imposter syndrome in this industry, and it's made worse when people minimize the challenges of this field. There's nothing worse than working with someone who thinks they know it all, because they're just bullshiting everyone, including themselves. 

So please everyone, from an experienced dev with a masters degree in this subject. Heed this advice: take your time, don't rush it, learn the concepts deeply and properly. If learning something is giving you anxiety, lower your expectations and try again, you'll get there eventually. And of course, try to have fun.

322,1658027428.0,What are the practical advantages of knowing automata theory?,"When I was a CS student, I remember taking the automata theory classes and being hooked by that thing so hard, that I'd take my notebook out in the buss stop to practice drawing those diagrams (I think it was called state transitions). 

It was fun thinking about it. Everyone absolutely hated that class though.

The professor used to say we'd use that later in Compiler Theory and/or lexical analysis, something like that.

Unfortunately, I dropped out before that semester ended.

I'm left wondering now, what's the purpose of that? Are there any practical advantages to know this when it comes to the job you do, especially if you're a programmer?

I mean, just saw some comments about this elsewhere, I found it extremely interested back then but never revisited the topic.",,90,0.99,30,https://www.reddit.com/r/computerscience/comments/w0xk1t/what_are_the_practical_advantages_of_knowing/

325,1650018984.0,How can Spotify’s search by lyrics feature be so ridiculously fast?,"Spotify offers a feature where you can search for a song writing the song’s lyrics in the search field. Spotify’s servers answer your query in a matter of seconds, if not milliseconds.

Now, my question is: from an algorithmic point of view, how can that be even remotely possible? I kind of understand how that would work when you are searching for a song title (a very efficient search algorithm operating on pre-sorted data on a server with a lot of computational power), but how can that work when looking for something like lyrics, where what you input is just enough words to make the result unique? 

(Of course, the Spotify example is just an example, and I’m sure lots of services offer similar and even more impressing features.)

328,1646347196.0,Are theoretical concepts really that important in computer science?," Within almost a full year into my computer science degree you start to see two types of modules; the ones that are more practical (programming, statistics, data analytics) and the ones that are theoretical (linear algebra, logic, set theory, discrete math’s etc.).

My question is how useful/practical are these theoretical concepts. Yes, I understand how there can be applications, i.e, truth tables can be used to replicate logic gates in a computer. But I’m talking about if I’ll use this knowledge beyond my degree. How often will I find the number of permutations of the number of dice rolls, how often will I reduce a matrix to row-echelon form or prove how two propositions are logically equivalent. 

I actually really enjoy learning these theoretical concepts, even more so than I do programming. But the reason why I pose this question is to see whether it’s beneficial for me to really study these topics, or whether I should just do enough to pass these classes and focus my time on the more in-demand skills like programming. I lose motivation when I study theory because in my head I’m like ‘I could really be improving my Java skills instead of learning about finite state automata’, so I close the book and just open my laptop. 

I understand computer science is a very large field and the obvious answer is probably ‘it depends on what you want to do in the future’. If anything, I’m simply trying to get a grasp of the involvement of theory in the practical field.

1,1686430573.0,/r/ComputerScience will be going dark starting June 12th in protest against Reddit's API changes which will kill 3rd party apps & tools,"## Update (June 16th, 2023):

This subreddit remains closed to new submissions and comments as part of the ongoing protest over Reddit policy changes. However, we've chosen to switch the subreddit to read-only, so that existing user contributions will not be censored.

# What's going on?

A recent Reddit policy change threatens to kill many beloved third-party mobile apps, making a great many quality-of-life features not seen in the official mobile app **permanently inaccessible** to users.

On May 31, 2023, Reddit announced they were raising the price to make calls to their API from being free to a level that will kill every third party app on Reddit, from Apollo to Reddit is Fun to Narwhal to BaconReader to Sync.

Even if you're not a mobile user and don't use any of those apps, this is a step toward killing other ways of customizing Reddit, such as Reddit Enhancement Suite or the use of the old.reddit.com desktop interface.

This isn't only a problem on the user level: many subreddit moderators depend on tools only available outside the official app to keep their communities on-topic and spam-free.

# What's the plan?

On June 12th, [many subreddits](https://reddit.com/r/ModCoord/comments/1401qw5/incomplete_and_growing_list_of_participating/) will be going dark to protest this policy. Some will return after 48 hours: others will go away *permanently* unless the issue is adequately addressed, since many moderators aren't able to put in the work they do with the poor tools available through the official app. This isn't something any of us do lightly: we do what we do because *we love Reddit*, and we truly believe this change will make it impossible to keep doing what we love.

The two-day blackout isn't the *goal*, and it isn't the end. Should things reach the 14th with no sign of Reddit choosing to fix what they've broken, we'll use the community and buzz we've built between then and now as a tool for further action.

What can *you* do?

1. **Complain.** Message the mods of r/reddit.com, who are the admins of the site: message /u/reddit: submit a [support request](https://support.reddithelp.com/hc/en-us/requests/new): comment in relevant threads on r/reddit, such as [this one](https://www.reddit.com/r/reddit/comments/12qwagm/an_update_regarding_reddits_api/), leave a negative review on their official iOS or Android app- and sign your username in support to this post.

1. **Spread the word.** Rabble-rouse on related subreddits. Meme it up, make it spicy. Bitch about it to your cat. Suggest anyone you know who moderates a subreddit join us at our sister sub at r/ModCoord - but please don't pester mods you don't know by simply spamming their modmail.

1. **Boycott and spread the word...to Reddit's competition!** Stay off Reddit entirely on June 12th through the 13th- instead, take to your favorite non-Reddit platform of choice and make some noise in support!

1. **Don't be a jerk.** As upsetting this may be, threats, profanity and vandalism will be worse than useless in getting people on our side.

3,1686513814.0,Question About Registers,"Hello everyone. There is a misunderstanding I have somewhere that I would like to clear up. 

I know that CPU registers are very fast and small and we can work with registers by writing assembly.

Here is where my misunderstanding/what I don't get lies: when I was taking my Architecture course, we had assignments where we had to program simple programs in assembly, like, say, a simple sort or something. 

If a program is running on the machine already, say I have a chat client running in the background on the machine, are the registers not in use running that program? How is it that I can write a sorting program in assembly moving values around to registers if the registers are already working with other data? Is there somehow no overlap?

What am I missing here?

If I want to MOV some value into some register like eax or something writing a program in assembly, how is there no other information there already such that I am overwriting or affecting other programs that are running?",mellowhorses,62,0.97,24,https://www.reddit.com/r/computerscience/comments/1473r8s/question_about_registers/

7,1686409304.0,Best Practices using LaTeX.,"I have just finished my first seventy page thesis in LaTeX and would like to share my tips with you on your way and would also like to hear your tips for using TeX here below the post.

I started TeX locally on my computer with TeXShop. Unfortunately, my computer broke down while I was working. I could only restore parts of my work through my backups. Partly I wanted to work on other computers. For me personally, Overleaf ([https://www.overleaf.com/](https://www.overleaf.com/)) has turned out to be a very good companion as an editor in the browser. Overleaf also gave very good formatting tips during the work with regard to creating tables, missing parameters using BiBTeX and much more.

I used Zotero ([https://www.zotero.org/](https://www.zotero.org/)) as library management software. In particular, I quickly lost track of what was relevant to my work and where. With the browser add-on, I was able to save the sources relatively quickly and create my bibliography in BiBTeX format.

Make backups of your interim work at any time. Even if Overleaf saves your results online, you should create backups that contain the entire source code. The Pro version even offers Git integration.

To create notes for my work in the meantime I can strongly recommend the Todo package (to be imported with \\usepackage{todonotes}). Using the command \\todo{your note} you can then mark corresponding paragraphs at the right place.

Since LaTeX sometimes places graphics elsewhere, I can also recommend the package placins. With its help you can limit the placement to certain sections. The package can be imported using (\\usepackage\[section\]{placeins}) with the parameter section for section-limiting.

My thesis also has programming code in the appendix. To format it code-wise I highly recommend the package listings (to be imported using \\usepackage{listings}) 

These were my biggest helpers, I hope I can be of some help to one or the other of you. If you are also currently working on a TeX project. Otherwise, I am very curious about your tips.

9,1686345949.0,I don't understand the Halting Problem,"The key to the solution, from what I've got so far, is imagining a machine that can detect whether or not another machine halts. We'll call that machine H, that takes as input a machine Q

Then, with some simple logic, we can make a machine that halts when H detects Q doesn't halt, and that doesn't halt when it detects Q halts. That'd be Hn

So, with this machine Hn, the paradox would emerge by doing Hn(Hn), since now, if it were to halt, it shouldn't halt, but if it doesn't halt, it should halt. Paradox.

But, one key thing I don't get: Doesn't the internal Hn also need an input? And wouldn't all of the subsequent machines need an input as well, until we reach a static program?

So instead of being Hn(Hn), shouldn't the paradox only arrive if you do Hn(Hn(Hn(...))) forever? and at that point the paradox isn't thanks to the algorithm, but rather because it's a [supertask](https://youtu.be/ffUnNaQTfZE).

&#x200B;

The same could be said if you build a machine that takes another machine (one that halts) as an input outputs 0 when the original outputs 1, and outputs 1 when the original outputs 0, let's call that one N

N(N) should also be a paradox, no? After all, if N outputs 0, it should output 1, but if it were to output 1, it should output 0!

If you don't provide an internal input for the machine you are using as input, of course you can't analyze how it's going to run.",androt14_,51,0.88,47,https://www.reddit.com/r/computerscience/comments/145hbhu/i_dont_understand_the_halting_problem/

22,1686146010.0,What kind of text-file format is the best for specifying trees.,"Hello.

I'm playing with the thought of writing a program  for rendering trees.

In the first instances, they are just rendered in the command line window as a regular tree.

I want to just make a text file to be parsed as a tree, with the bare minimum of fuzz, so it is as easy as possible to define a tree, but with as little amount of ambiguity as possible. And it should be easy to edit the definition, add delete
nodes and so on.

I have thought of using markdown headings for speciffying levels, but thinks that even that is a little too much.

As I see it I have two alternatives that are viable:

* tab indentation 

    root
        level1
             level 2
        level1
             level 2
                 And so on

* markdown headers, much like the first one.

I think, having to make the user write it as a tree is implemented in an array is too much.

I wonder if I am overlooking some other options for defining a tree by a text file, which is just as easy. (I have considered numbering, but thinks renumbering will be too big a chore.)

**Edit**

I want a file format as simple as possible for being able to parse a text file as an inorder binary tree, with as little markup as humanly possible, and yet leave as little room as possible for ambiguities.

The motivation behind this, is to lower the threshold for drawing a graph down to nothing. The end goal, is to output pic scripts you can edit further, and then have pic render the diagrams as svg or whatever format available.

Hello there!

After three weeks of learning the basics of graphs, I think it is time to show you examples of how we can translate real-life problems to the graph theory domain

This will be the last of a series of posts introducing the basic concepts of graph theory before we dive into topics such as traversals, and finding cycles, among others.

Here’s a summary of what we have covered in the previous editions:

1. Introduction to the concepts of [nodes, edges, and connectivity](https://albexl.substack.com/p/introduction-to-graph-theory).
2. Defining what are [neighbors, degrees, and colorings](https://albexl.substack.com/p/an-introduction-to-graphs-ii) in graphs.
3. How to [represent graphs](https://albexl.substack.com/p/graphs-representation) in a computer program.

Today, we will learn about practical examples of how to use graphs in real life. For that, we are going to see examples of “games” that are played on boards. They might seem unrelated to graphs, but the truth is that they are more closely related than you might think.

At the end of the post, you will find some algorithmic challenges so you can try and apply some of the topics that I will explain today. Feel free to skip to that part if you think you already have the necessary skills to solve them.

Let’s begin!

## An Initial Problem

Let’s dive in straight to the matter. Take a look at the following problem and think about how you would approach it:

https://preview.redd.it/krf1rmu0nr3b1.png?width=1304&format=png&auto=webp&s=c6890cc02f7ecafa3327f392163608c2660c39d1

By simple inspection, we can notice that there are three “sets“ of floor tiles that can be identified as “rooms“. These are all the rooms highlighted and numbered: 

https://preview.redd.it/skr7qk73nr3b1.png?width=649&format=png&auto=webp&s=974ae5fafd8e618a05834c62ccb1dc555baf635d

Intuitively, we identify these “connected“ regions and we sort them out as “rooms” because it just makes sense in our heads.

But what if this was the input to a program? How could we design an algorithm that a computer will execute to find the number of “rooms” in any map of a house that uses this representation?

Well, unfortunately, before thinking about designing algorithms we have to think about modeling this problem in terms that a computer can understand. And one possibility, as you might have suspected already, is doing so by using graphs.

## Representing Boards as Graphs

Let’s talk about a classical way of representing boards using graphs. Take a look at the following problem and try to think of a solution.

This time go a bit further and try to think of a general solution, instead of just solving this particular instance. It’s ok if you can’t, I will show you how to do it soon.

https://preview.redd.it/f04jvvg6nr3b1.png?width=1304&format=png&auto=webp&s=f4eb98877382658edbc5f182e3f522126ce6c5c3

Once again, our brains might identify that there are only two paths between the highlighted squares, and we can easily spot which one is the shortest: 

https://preview.redd.it/j8b1n009nr3b1.png?width=1555&format=png&auto=webp&s=2b62fe71c2b3091ed3735d24b3d9cbf575d29002

The path shown on the left takes 9 steps while the one on the right takes 11 steps.

But, who defined what a path is in this problem? Who defined which tiles we can move to when standing on a specific tile?

Our brains (or at least mine) intuitively assumed that the possible moves from a given position were the following:

https://preview.redd.it/v7qf7k0bnr3b1.png?width=256&format=png&auto=webp&s=204d5817b885b926f020b7479fdc84fef4cc64e5

So, as long as we are not trying to go to a “wall” tile, we can move to the left, right, up, or down.

Let’s take this set of movements and the “floor“ tiles and see how they relate to graphs. Assuming that the start and end tiles are also floor tiles, we can number every floor tile arbitrarily like this:

https://preview.redd.it/jwkf1lohnr3b1.png?width=649&format=png&auto=webp&s=c1e17e2971c1c99f9a658111f0a9646be0a27ade

We have 14 “floor” tiles, which can be represented as 14 nodes of a graph. So, what about the edges?

Let’s add an edge between two pairs of nodes if it exists a valid movement between their corresponding tiles on the map. For example, we can add edges between nodes 1 and 2, and also between nodes 13 and 14.

That being said, our problem can be reduced to finding the path with the minimum length between two nodes in an undirected graph.

This is the graph that results from taking every floor tile as a node and adding edges according to the valid moves that we defined:

https://preview.redd.it/u94iiezjnr3b1.png?width=2195&format=png&auto=webp&s=33388b27b52c9b19d444a51fd51b264f9248d7fa

The problem of finding a path with the minimum length between two nodes is a standard problem in the graph theory domain, and we will learn how to solve it in future posts of this series.

For the moment, let’s go back to our initial problem and try to model it using graphs applying what we learned from this example.

## Counting the Rooms

Let’s recall the problem we saw at the beginning of this post:

https://preview.redd.it/q63774ymnr3b1.png?width=1304&format=png&auto=webp&s=924e910b5767e9b60a7746efb2a798491bb6c585

Let’s number every floor tile, and assume that we have the same possible moves that we described above. That is, from a given tile we can move to the tiles at its right, left, top, and bottom as long as they are not “wall“ tiles.

A possible numbering could be the following:

https://preview.redd.it/bgtr6e0pnr3b1.png?width=649&format=png&auto=webp&s=3d451e28cf81d8ec82a07fcf60ea7ac9bd4fcfda

 Translating this map to a graph the same way we did before, we get the following: 

https://preview.redd.it/bz9ymsjqnr3b1.png?width=806&format=png&auto=webp&s=0311f27afc7d52f5a7f3cfde5c5a36d250c30b2c

And if we were to solve the problem of counting the number of rooms in a graph, we could rephrase that as counting the number of its [connected components](https://albexl.substack.com/p/introduction-to-graph-theory).

See all the “rooms“ taken to the domain of connected components below:

https://preview.redd.it/2xc3ctrtnr3b1.png?width=1742&format=png&auto=webp&s=305209b6f203bc9cf9921b2e15698aa1e05c736c

As you also might suspect, the problem of finding the connected components in an undirected graph is also a standard problem that can be solved by using various graph algorithms.

We will be covering those algorithms and more in future editions of Algorithmically Speaking.

In the meantime, it’s time to try what you’ve learned!

## Test Your Skills

I have seen a variety of challenges and puzzles on boards that I would like to share some of them with you today.

I would suggest that you try to focus first on solving them by any means possible and then try to think about how to model this problem using a bit of graph theory.

As I [promised before](https://albexl.substack.com/p/one-month-of-algorithmic-posts), no more plain-text statements. Here we go:

**Problem #1:**

https://preview.redd.it/xgj16v8znr3b1.png?width=1533&format=png&auto=webp&s=0e2c4b2ada71956c934bff787cdc79f71f0f93a3

 **Problem #2:**

https://preview.redd.it/za6no143or3b1.png?width=1304&format=png&auto=webp&s=ed8e954472dbe4201880e15f851e254ded26fc87

## Conclusions

I hope I was able to keep igniting your passion for graph theory by showing you some basic guidelines on how to model board problems using graphs.

This approach is used in numerous real-life applications (at the top of my mind I can think of numerous examples related to the gaming industry).

Also, I recently stumbled upon this [video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZMQbHMgK2rw&t=795s) where I found out about a competition that has been going on for more than 50 years and has a lot to do with boards, mazes, and of course, graphs.

Some takeaways:

* Board problems can usually be modeled as graphs by taking some set of tiles as the nodes and the possible moves between the tiles as the edges.
* Usually, board games involve tasks such as counting regions, or finding paths which are usually standard problems of the graph theory domain.
* The chessboard is a [bipartite graph](https://albexl.substack.com/p/an-introduction-to-graphs-ii). Do you see it now?

I wish you good luck when solving this week’s challenges. Don’t forget to share your progress with the community!

If you think this post can be helpful for someone, share it with them. Nothing will make me happier!

50,1685640992.0,A Manifesto for Cloud-Oriented Programming from the creator of the CDK,"In this [insightful article](https://docs.winglang.io/blog/2022/11/23/manifesto), Elad Ben-Israel, the mind behind the CDK, shares his love for the cloud, but also his frustrations with the complexity of building cloud applications. The challenges he identifies include:
1. Focus on non-functional mechanics: The need to understand and manage cloud platform mechanics instead of focusing on building valuable features for users.
2. Lack of independence: Developers often need to rely on others to handle parts of the deployment process or to resolve issues, interrupting their work flow.
3. Delayed feedback: The current iteration cycle in cloud development can take minutes or even longer, significantly slowing down the development process and making it harder for developers to stay in their flow state.

## It's not just a rant
Elad is not just ranting about cloud development. He proposes a solution in the form of a programming language for the cloud. This language would treat the entire cloud as its computer. The language compiler will be able to see the complete cloud application, unbound by the limits of individual machines. Such a compiler would be able to handle a significant portion of the application's non-functional aspects, enabling developers to operate at a more abstract level, thus reducing complexity and promoting autonomy. Moreover, it could expedite iteration cycles by allowing to compile applications to quick local simulators during the development process. 

## The Winglang Project
Elad reveals that he's in the process of developing such an open-source, “cloud-oriented” language, dubbed [Winglang](https://github.com/winglang/wing). Wing aims to improve the developer experience of cloud applications by enabling developers to build distributed systems that leverage cloud services as first-class citizens. This is achieved by integrating infrastructure and application code in a secure, unified programming model. Wing programs can be executed locally via a fully-functional simulator or deployed to any cloud provider.

## My Interest in Winglang
I, together with a group of dedicated contributors, joined forces with Elad to develop Winglang.
While still in Alpha and not yet ready for production use, it's already possible to build some [real applications](https://github.com/winglang/research/tree/main/dogfooding).

54,1685557044.0,Need help (newbie) - Church-encoded Booleans,"Hi everyone,

I don't know where to ask, so I come to this place. I know that we're not to ask questions regarding programming issues in this subreddit, but I didn't find any programming subreddit (including lisp, scheme and the like) that felt appropriate because I'm stuck at the theoretical, mathematical, logical level.

I'm taking CS classes at Uni, but it's a non-standard ""lateral"" track, so we're to study a lot of stuff on our own. I'm currently trying to get a grasp on the lambda calculus because I feel it is helpful for functional programming.

I'm at a loss when it comes to understanding Church booleans.

(I know ""normal"" booleans from programming languages like Java, were you set x (or boolean x) = true or ask whether x == 5 or 4 == 7 which might evualuate to true or false).

So, my ""hang-up"":

Church convention:

true ≡ λa.λb. a

false ≡ λa.λb. b

If you use beta reduction, true gives you back whatever you use and discards λb.

λa.λb. a (5)

\----> 5

but

λa.λb. b (5)

\----> 5

...that is the same and \_almost\_ like the identity function. This, I don't understand.

But my bigger problem, which, of course, probably arises from not properly understanding Church booleans in the first place, is if-then.

if ≡ λp.λa.λb. p a b

How do I go from here to ""choosing λa if true and λb if false""?

My first try was obviously BS because I used the bound variables of λa and λb for λp, which was not so smart.

\[This was my try for ""True"":

    λp.λa.λb. p a b                      (TRUE) a b
    λp.λa.λb. p a b                      (λa.λb. a) a b
    λa.λb. ( (λa.λb. a) a b)              a b
    λa.λb.  ((λb. a)  b)                  a b

eeerm...what?....oops.

... yeah, didn't make sense. I don't think I can use a and b when it comes to p because they are already lambda-bound?)

&#x200B;

How does p --> TRUE ""trigger"" an output of λa and p --> FALSE λb?

&#x200B;

Thank you so much in advance!

66,1685178618.0,A Visual Introduction to how we represent Graphs in a Computer Program,"Hello there!

Today we will be diving into one of the most common ways of representing data and modeling problems (and solutions) in Computer Science. We will be talking about **Graphs**.

This is the third of a series of posts introducing graph theory in a very visual way.

Now that we know some basic definitions of graph theory, it is time to see how graphs can be represented in a program. We will explore the most common representations and analyze their pros and cons.

**This is a summary version of the weekly edition of the Algorithmically Speaking newsletter. You can read the full article here:**

[Algorithmically Speaking - #5: Representing Graphs](https://albexl.substack.com/p/graphs-representation)

 Let’s begin! 

 \_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_ 

## Edge List

The first representation we will explore today is the **edge list** representation. As its name implies, it consists of a **list** with the **edges** of the graph.

An edge in this list consists of an ordered pair (x, y), representing that there is an edge from node x to node y.

Let’s look at the following graph, where we have numbered the nodes from 1 to 5, and look at the corresponding edge list representation:

https://preview.redd.it/z91ljjiu8c2b1.png?width=3423&format=png&auto=webp&s=758ab0e180d88bfb0ca0497c94fe513bc91973b3

Notice that this graph is **directed**. If the pair (x, y) is present in the list, there is an edge starting in x and ending in y, but the opposite does not hold unless the pair (y, x) also appears in the list.

If the graph is **undirected**, then the edge list representation will contain the ordered pairs (x, y) and (y, x) for every pair of adjacent nodes x and y.

If we would like to represent a **weighted** graph, the most natural way to do it is by extending our representation of an edge to be a triplet instead of a pair.

Let’s say we have edges starting from node x, ending in node y, with a weight of w. One way to represent those edges would be with a triplet of the form (x, y, w).

Let’s add some weights to our previous graph and see what its edge list representation would look like:

https://preview.redd.it/0ou8n7bz8c2b1.png?width=3690&format=png&auto=webp&s=97483bb05e0f23c55b416101c2269806c6ff9830

The edge list representation is particularly useful for algorithms that process the edges of the graphs in some order. We will be exploring some of those algorithms when dealing with the **Minimum Spanning Tree** or the **Dynamic Connectivity** problems.

But this will be in future posts. In the meantime, let’s move on to the next representation.

## Adjacency Matrix

An **adjacency matrix** is a two-dimensional array indicating the edges of the graph. Let’s denote this matrix as G.

Each value G\[x\]\[y\] indicates whether the graph contains an edge from node x to node y. If the edge is included in the graph, then G\[x\]\[y\] = 1, and otherwise G\[x\]\[y\] = 0.

Let’s take a look at our initial graph and its corresponding adjacency matrix:

https://preview.redd.it/ay9r81sh9c2b1.png?width=4350&format=png&auto=webp&s=c10b3c56031f41bc369fd08bc4d9d0b6916be2f0

Being able to read an adjacency matrix can give you insightful information about the graph.

For example, inspecting the previous matrix, we can realize that node number 1 has the most outgoing edges, while node number 5 has the least (actually it doesn’t have any):

https://preview.redd.it/p4kqcagv9c2b1.png?width=4350&format=png&auto=webp&s=c58ef832226a162d01bee305d0939fdc31802674

Also, we can notice how even if it doesn’t have any outgoing edge, node number 5 has the largest number of incoming edges. On the other hand, node number 1 has no incoming edges:

https://preview.redd.it/37sip89pac2b1.png?width=4350&format=png&auto=webp&s=ad3705d146a1a59036b58897f139f72c3932c62e

If the graph is weighted, the adjacency matrix representation can be extended so that the matrix contains the weight of the edge if the edge exists. Otherwise, it will contain the number 0:

https://preview.redd.it/tcehhnvuac2b1.png?width=4350&format=png&auto=webp&s=a33666da827faacc78b53632709ef3c9e8d94921

 ***Note:*** *We are choosing the number* 0 *to represent the absence of an edge because it is convenient in this case. Nevertheless, for solving some graph-related problems, this number can vary. For example,* -1 *or a very big (or small) number can be used instead.*

One of the greatest advantages of the adjacency matrix representation is that we can efficiently verify the existence of an edge. By indexing in a position \[x\]\[y\], we immediately know whether there is an edge or not between nodes x and y.

On the other hand, one of its greatest drawbacks is the fact that it requires O(n\^2) space to represent a graph with n nodes.

Let’s move forward to the last representation we’ll be exploring today!

## Adjacency List

The **adjacency list** representation is the most common way to represent graphs since most of the classic graph algorithms can be implemented very efficiently using this representation.

Every node x will be assigned a list that will contain all the nodes to which there is an edge from x.

Let’s see an example:

https://preview.redd.it/4bu3jcg7bc2b1.png?width=3666&format=png&auto=webp&s=31bc8556a5f0dcc594d6a61aafb3c588ab2a33d1

Notice how in this representation we store the exact neighbors for every node, instead of allocating space for all of the n nodes of the graph, as in the adjacency matrix representation.

Let’s take a look at node number 1 and its neighbors:

https://preview.redd.it/6arasajabc2b1.png?width=3666&format=png&auto=webp&s=f4a27e1f87ff264017755ff6f680dc9f1d0f1b51

We could store ordered pairs instead of single integers to represent weighted graphs. The pairs would be of the form (y, w), where y represents a node and w represents the weight of the edge.

Adding some weights to our previous graph:

https://preview.redd.it/rlsbnlhgbc2b1.png?width=4368&format=png&auto=webp&s=2bfbe5712624fdfeee382f82e247533b717278a1

 And once again, taking node number 1 as an example: 

https://preview.redd.it/jnmmg4iibc2b1.png?width=4368&format=png&auto=webp&s=0f7ab2112cad22d4c1a92c3e33d8857de990062e

An advantage of using adjacency lists is efficiently finding the nodes to which there is an edge from a given node.

Notice that, potentially, a graph can have O(n\^2) edges, which would result in this representation using the same amount of memory that the adjacency matrix representation uses. But this is rarely the case in most practical graph problems.

On the other hand, if we would want to check whether there is an edge between nodes x  
 and y we would have to iterate the adjacency list of x until we find node y or reach the end of the list. So, adjacency matrices take the lead here.

In future posts, we will explore algorithms for traversing graphs, finding shortest paths, or determining valid colorings.

Most of these algorithms behave very differently depending on the type of representation we use for our graphs.

75,1684967623.0,I recently derived a new line drawing function that hasn't ever been off by a few pixels and hasnt ever had gaps," 

Bresenham's line drawing algorithm always goes off by a few pixels when I implement it, so I derived my own in a similar way.

y=mx+b

y=dy/dx x + b

dx y = dy x + dx b

0 = dy x - dx y + dx b

f(m, n) = dy m - dx n + dx b

N = f(x+t, y+u), f(x,y) = 0  
N = dy(x+t) - dx(y+u) + dx b

\- 0 = dy x - dx y + dx b

N = dy t - dx u

Let u = v+1/2:  
N = dy t - dx (v+1/2)

0 > dy t - dx (v+1/2)  
dx(v+1/2) > dy t

dx (2v+1) > 2 dy t

This is the implementation that I be using as of this time.

void drawLine(int x0, int y0, int x1, int y1, rgb color) {  
int dx = abs(x1 - x0);  
int dy = abs(y1 - y0);  
int tilt = dy < dx ? -1 : 1;  
int step = tilt == -1 ? x0 < x1 ? -1 : 1 : y0 < y1 ? -1 : 1;  
int mode = tilt == -1 ? y1 < y0 ? -1 : 1 : x1 < x0 ? -1 : 1;  
int sV = tilt == -1 ? x0 > x1 ? x1 : x0 : y0 > y1 ? y1 : y0;  
int eV = tilt == -1 ? x0 > x1 ? x0 : x1 : y0 > y1 ? y0 : y1;  
int L = tilt == -1 ? dx : dy;  
int R = tilt == -1 ? dy : dx;  
for(int i = sV, h = 0, l = L, r = -R, c = tilt == -1 ? x0 > x1 ? y1 : y0 : y0 > y1 ? x1 : x0; i <= eV; i++) {  
if(l < (r += 2 \* R)) { h++; l += 2 \* L; }  
if(tilt == -1) plot(i, c - h \* step \* mode, color);  
if(tilt == 1) plot(c - h \* step \* mode, i, color);

}

}

It hasn't been tested as far as I know, so I'm not sure if changing step and mode would break the function if it were to undergo extensive use, but this is an optimization that could be done:  
int hStep = x0 < x1 ? tilt : -tilt;

int vStep = y0 < y1 ? -tilt : tilt;

&#x200B;

Since line drawing functions are easily called countless times a frame, it would probably go faster due to checking that less, but I'm not sure how messing with the first one, which be more rigorous would affect things after extensive use.",NotWhiteRice,13,0.68,3,https://www.reddit.com/r/computerscience/comments/13r032h/i_recently_derived_a_new_line_drawing_function/

77,1684934150.0,HtDP vs SICS (intro CS courses): a discussion,"Good morning all!

I would love to have a discussion on pros/cons of two of the most popular Comp-Sci intro courses I have seen in different CS/programming forums, these are SICS (Structure and Interpretation of Computer Programs) and HtDP (How to Design programs). 

Some background: I am in a fortunate situation where I took an open source web-dev bootcamp and ended up getting a job as a software dev at a place I really love. The bootcamp certainly prepared me for many of the higher level topics in web/cloud dev however, I would really like to expand my own CS education as my undergrad was in physics and I feel many intro CS topics are missing from my toolbelt.   


I have narrowed the ""start"" of my journey to the two video-curriculum-based classes mentioned above, each being pushed by their own open-source ""undergrad education tracks."" OSSU ([https://github.com/ossu/computer-science](https://github.com/ossu/computer-science)) with HtDP and teachyourselfcs ([https://teachyourselfcs.com/](https://teachyourselfcs.com/)) with SICP. I started with OSSU as they have a verbose course-load with a large community, however I've had some MAJOR issues with the HtDP course that have really made me rethink that decision and would love to have some discussion & ideas from those that may have more/other experience and hopefully also create a resource for those that have this dilemma in the future. Below are my pros/cons for each.  


HtDP  
pros:  
\- a part of the OSSU curriculum  
\- unique approach to problem-solving first & tdd  
cons:  
\- ANY course access behind a paywall (3 months) on edEx  
\- many practice problems in the course behind a paywall (there is a separate problem bank)  
\- done in a course-specific & not very popular language (racket, which is a BSL language?)  
\- pretty much requires their IDE, DrRacket, which (in my opinion) is horrible  
\- tons of graphic-based problems & projects (this con is certainly opinion based)  


ICS  
pros:  
\- multiple courses taught using the SICP book including those from MIT, Berkeley, and even more ""modern"" ones using python  
\- open to the use of multiple languages (though Scheme, a Lisp dialect, is recommended)  
\- lots of language resources  
\- can esily use your own IDE/environment  
\- no paywalls on most of the courses I've seen  
cons:  
\- older/less-modern classes  
So... these lists probably do a good job of highlighting my biases and frustrations haha, hence why I'd like to have conversations with others. I've been completely turned off of the HtDP course by their paywalls and incredibly specific language/topics - this brings back memories of undergrad professors making you buy THEIR textbook - and just gives me a bad taste in my mouth and reeks of money. Both courses have free books so you can easily self-teach/pace yourself without their video-curriculum-courses, but I'd like to have that structure in my life as I'm working a full-time job. At this point, I'm likely just going to start the SICP Berkeley course, but the beginning of the HtDP was so unique and interesting in its TDD methodology and interface work I'm honestly a bit sad to leave it behind. Using a separate IDE & environment from the one I use at work every day and learned on is just unacceptable to me and figuring out how to replicate the work in my own just isn't worth the time investment (to me). Honestly, just a bit frustrated at all of the work I've tried to put into HtDP just to have course access removed after 3 months and having to make another fake account to reset all progress combined with their community's mentality of ""oh just do it, you must not be motivated enough!"" I'm an adult in a full-time job trying to learn, so I don't always have time to finish up a course this quickly, what can I say?

78,1684856872.0,Is it possible (in theory) to do computations using wave interference?,"So, here's my question: can you do adition, subtraction, multiplication, division, (maybe even exponents and roots!) with nothing but wave interference?

&#x200B;

Basically, you have 2 photons that have the number encoded in each one. You have them interfere, then decode it. If destructive interference, it would subtract the number from it (a 10 would be twoice as much as a 5, so subtracting them would make a 5). Do the opposite, and you get a higher energy wave from those 2 merging (constructive interference), making a 15!

Could such a system work for computations? (I doubt it would be good on modern day computers, but on massive computers that are big enough that the speed difference between electrons and photons is noticible, a system of mirrors and interference could allow calculations to occur at light speed).

So, could addition and subtraction be done that way? If so, could multiplication and division be done *directly*, or would you just have to send a signal saying ""continue doing this ""x"" times"". What about exponents?

## Neighbors and Degrees

Two nodes are **neighbors** or **adjacent** if there is an edge between them. The **degree** of a node is the number of its neighbors.

In the following graph, we have highlighted a node (colored in green), its neighbors (colored in red), and the edges between them (colored in blue):

https://preview.redd.it/jvl23n8vey0b1.png?width=771&format=png&auto=webp&s=18708ac8986ca1fd7d6ef1ba33b192216fcb8725

 We can see that the green node has three incident edges and three neighbors, and therefore, it has a degree equal to 3.

In the next image, we can see the degree of every node:

https://preview.redd.it/0t39le8yey0b1.png?width=771&format=png&auto=webp&s=f16cea127a7992d600b19efa87996748e30c5d73

Something to notice is the fact that the sum of degrees in a graph is always 2m, where m is the number of edges. This happens because each edge increases the degree of exactly two nodes by one. So, the sum of the degrees is always even.

A graph is **regular** if the degree of every node is a constant d. A graph is **complete** if the degree of every node is n−1, where n is the number of nodes in the graph. That is, the graph contains all possible edges between the nodes. By definition, a complete graph is a regular graph.

Here’s an example of a regular graph that is not complete. Notice how the degree of every node is 2:

https://preview.redd.it/bwfrwpd4fy0b1.png?width=479&format=png&auto=webp&s=530ddf6f453e469d1c48e9b5cab34dcccc6acf18

And this is an example of a complete graph. Notice how the degree of every node is 3 and there are 4 nodes: 

https://preview.redd.it/ba443hp6fy0b1.png?width=479&format=png&auto=webp&s=613e6cfc34180beffb17c90f123bb955b08a7c00

When we are referring to directed graphs, we define the **indegree** of a node as the number of edges that end at the node, and the **outdegree** of a node as the number of edges that start at the node.

Here’s an example highlighting a node with an indegree equal to 2 and an outdegree equal to 1:

https://preview.redd.it/zsztfb9bfy0b1.png?width=771&format=png&auto=webp&s=f79bda1967ee721c48abb24d957b0a4214517aca

And these are the values of indegree/outdegree for every node. Notice how some nodes can have indegree or outdegree equal to 0:

https://preview.redd.it/gehnxdeefy0b1.png?width=780&format=png&auto=webp&s=862850d6cdae875c579179d484463b13dc0005d6

## Colorings

In a **coloring** of a graph, each node is assigned a color so that no adjacent nodes have the same color.

A graph is called **bipartite** if it is possible to find a coloring of its nodes using two colors. It can be proven that a graph is bipartite exactly when it does not contain a cycle with an odd number of edges.

For example, the following graph is bipartite:

https://preview.redd.it/u3ff564kiy0b1.png?width=771&format=png&auto=webp&s=f2fc3727103e4960f4f12348df9cdd73905c0ce7

 We can claim that it is bipartite because we can find a coloring of the graph using only two colors:

https://preview.redd.it/5q6tlbamiy0b1.png?width=771&format=png&auto=webp&s=a94bc6fb6e332cbf339c94e1718aab36831641f5

And here’s a more intuitive way to visualize bipartite graphs. The previous and the following graphs are the same: 

https://preview.redd.it/323j7qmoiy0b1.png?width=604&format=png&auto=webp&s=f5d2fda73372482f91636d8ed28b4511c72800c8

With this representation, it becomes visually more clear that the nodes can be split into two sets, and that every edge in the graph connects nodes from different sets.

Now, let’s take a look at the following graph:

https://preview.redd.it/zw1ejb3riy0b1.png?width=771&format=png&auto=webp&s=9b2327d0cc3a220489b0b45add7e217cf5cf5a08

No matter how hard you try, you won’t be able to find a coloring of this graph using only two colors. Remember earlier, when we said that cycles of odd length and bipartiteness are related?

Inspecting the graph closely, we can notice that it contains a cycle of length 3. It won’t be possible to color this cycle (or the entire graph) using only two colors:

https://preview.redd.it/32fw886tiy0b1.png?width=771&format=png&auto=webp&s=03f2155022d4c1eb696d067ab4abba305c15283a

In future posts, we will explore algorithms to determine if a graph is bipartite or not. Also, we will dig deeper into how the degrees of nodes play an important role in finding topological orderings in directed graphs.",albeXL,29,0.87,0,https://www.reddit.com/r/computerscience/comments/13mng69/a_visual_introduction_to_the_concepts_of_degrees/

* Evolution of programming abstractions.
* Challenges of cloud abstractions.
* Importance of tools like stack traces for debugging, especially in distributed systems.

Gregor emphasizes that effective cloud abstractions are crucial but tricky to get right. He points out that debugging at the abstraction level can be complex and underscores the value of good error messages and observability. 

The part about the ""unhappy path"" particularly resonated with me: 

>The unhappy path is where many abstractions struggle. Software that makes building small systems easy but struggles with real-world development scenarios like debugging or automated testing is an unwelcome version of “demoware” - it demos well, but doesn’t actually work in the real world. And there’s no unlock code. ... I propose the following test for vendors demoing higher-level development systems:  
>  
>1. Ask them to enter a typo into one of the fields where the developer is expected to enter some logic.  
>  
>2. Ask them to leave the room for two minutes while we change a few random elements of their demo configuration. Upon return, they would have to debug and figure out what was changed.

>Needless to say, no vendor ever picked the challenge.

# Why it interests me

I'm one of the creators of [Winglang](https://github.com/winglang/wing), an open-source programming language for the cloud that allows developers to work at a higher level of abstraction. 

We set a goal for ourselves to provide good debugging experience that will allow developers to debug cloud applications in the context of the logical structure of the apps.

[Algorithmically Speaking - #3: Nodes, Edges, and Connectivity](https://albexl.substack.com/p/introduction-to-graph-theory)

Let’s begin!

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

## Nodes, Edges, and Paths

A **graph** consists of **nodes** and **edges**. We could see the nodes as the fundamental entities of graphs, and edges represent the relationships between nodes.

One good thing about graphs is that, even if they represent an abstract mathematical definition, we can visually display them using the most simple drawings of circles and lines.

Here’s a hand-drawn image of a graph with 5 nodes and 7 edges that we will we use to help us understand some basic definitions:

https://preview.redd.it/0a1y8llz8kza1.png?width=771&format=png&auto=webp&s=e13eb20bb4d163185d0b754ce8a619c2c6abd44a

A **path** leads from node **a** to node **b** through the edges of the graph. The length of a path is the number of edges in it.

The highlighted (red) path between the two green nodes in the following image is of length 3:

https://preview.redd.it/a36yrzy09kza1.png?width=771&format=png&auto=webp&s=dc22c26073857a8d5a773e081e7929af429c67f3

>***Note****: The highlighted path is just one of the possible paths between the two green nodes. Try to identify every possible path between them.*

A path is a **cycle** if the first and last node is the same. On the other hand, a path is called **simple** if each node appears at most once in the path.

The highlighted path in the previous image corresponds to a simple path, while the one in the following image is considered a cycle:

https://preview.redd.it/hpnn0bz39kza1.png?width=771&format=png&auto=webp&s=c981d45b507ec9cddf18e3dbd1f445da167b9ff3

## Connectivity

A graph is **connected** if there is a path between any two nodes. For example, our initial graph is connected:

https://preview.redd.it/aldp6s2o9kza1.png?width=771&format=png&auto=webp&s=315fd6168db76955c5f7469e63246228dd829857

>***Try it yourself****: take any pair of nodes in the previous graph and check that, indeed, there is a path between them.*

On the other hand, the following graph is **not connected** because there is no path between the highlighted nodes:

https://preview.redd.it/u1wp2s2lakza1.png?width=1012&format=png&auto=webp&s=7684d57bebc41f14bfaf7b48cb67bb0284610563

In fact, there is no path between any node located in the right-bottom corner and any node located in the left-top corner.

The sets of connected nodes in a graph are called **connected components**. Here are the connected components (nodes with the same color) of the previous graph:

https://preview.redd.it/h049y5nnakza1.png?width=1296&format=png&auto=webp&s=2e0495b2e55586068ba40a158dcd11fcbf9ccbd8

We can clearly see that this graph has two connected components.

A **tree** is a connected graph that consists of **n** nodes and **n−1** edges. There is a unique path between any two nodes of a tree. You can also think of a tree as a connected graph that doesn’t contain any cycles.

The following graph is a tree:

https://preview.redd.it/b29o042rakza1.png?width=771&format=png&auto=webp&s=2158bdac8f4013ed1f327e7a8129dc111dae5171

>***Try it yourself****: take any pair of nodes in the previous graph and check that, indeed, there is a* ***unique*** *path between them.*

## Direction and Weights

A graph is **directed** if the edges can be traversed in one direction only. For example, the following graph is directed:

https://preview.redd.it/qduyg4btakza1.png?width=771&format=png&auto=webp&s=8bbd5eecbd306c9b5e207feab5fea676ed1bfc9c

Notice how in the following image there is a path (more than one actually) between the green node and the blue node, but the opposite is not true. You cannot find any path starting in the blue node and ending in the green one:

https://preview.redd.it/x04bpvlkckza1.png?width=771&format=png&auto=webp&s=a5a8f97b1f4d4e3610ce17aa6433008f7eeb7dd6

As we can see, the fact the graph is directed affects the concept of connectivity, which is called **strong connectivity** when we are referring to directed graphs. We will learn more about this in future posts.

In a **weighted** graph, each edge is assigned a **weight**. The weights are often interpreted as edge lengths.

The following graph is weighted:

https://preview.redd.it/convruznckza1.png?width=771&format=png&auto=webp&s=9b29d6107bf86ae4ecbf305c3602d1f01e609ece

The length of a path in a weighted graph is the **sum** of the edge weights on the path. For example, in the following graph, the length of the highlighted path between the green nodes is 13 (8 + 5):

https://preview.redd.it/orcc39orckza1.png?width=771&format=png&auto=webp&s=18e069b59160b40f18f94ae7037b4f5d44cb1779

In future posts, we will explore algorithms related to connectivity, we will dig deeper into the importance of weights, and will learn some definitions that only make sense when we are talking about directed graphs.",albeXL,109,0.97,5,https://www.reddit.com/r/computerscience/comments/13gc8jm/a_visual_introduction_to_the_basic_concepts_of/

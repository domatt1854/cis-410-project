2,1701542778.0,Career Outcomes for MCS program (either in-person or online),"I’m a potential applicant to the MCS program with a BS CS degree and with about 1 year of SWE experience by the time I would start the program. I have a couple of questions about the career impact of the MCS degree so any help/advice from current students or alumni would be much appreciated!

Is there a place to view the career outcomes or profiles of UIUC MCS grads? What are the general job/internship prospects for people who are in the program now or have recently completed it? Do graduates get opportunities to break in to the tech industry (assuming they have strong experience, projects, and skillset along with the degree)? I understand that degrees and certs are not always a significant boost in this field, but my main motive for the program is to learn more about SWE concepts in a classroom setting, and to have a chance to build cool projects that can help me in recruiting with companies in the future. I apologize if these questions have already been asked here, but most of the similar posts I found were over a year old. The UIUC website lists the outcomes for graduates across their engineering college, but nothing I found was specifically geared towards MCS. If anyone is comfortable with sharing their offers or job impacts, that would be super helpful as well.

3,1701464500.0,Course selection for those just starting the UIUC MCS,"Hi everyone, 

I've learned so much from this subreddit! It's been invaluable and truly appreciate everyone's thoughts/perspectives. I've been accepted to the 2024 Spring cohort of the online MCS and am super excited about jumping back into CS. I'm many years removed from my undergrad years, and I'm now in a C-suite level position in healthcare, still practicing medicine, and also running a growing health tech company. It's been a few years since I've done a lot of coding, but hopefully will be able to get up to speed quickly. 

With that in mind, what would be a good first course to take? I was thinking of starting with CS441 Applied Machine Learning. If so, any recommendations for what I can do to prepare for the class? Should I be brushing up on numpy, R, linear algebra, etc?  I'd say my professional work life is insanely busy so anything I can do to make the learning curve less steep or finish assignments as soon as possible would help me with planning around work activities. Any recs would be much appreciated

Thank you!

Has anyone been admitted to the Chicago program?

By looking at the course guide, it seems that the number of classes available to Chicago campus students is a tiny fraction of the ones offered on campus or on the online MCS. Also, some of these classes are taught during work hours and the midterms are also scheduled during work hours.

Does anyone have experience with the program? Is attendance during those hours mandatory? Is it possible to take online classes as an MCS Chicago student?

13,1700945281.0,24 spring on-campus program consideration,"Hi,

I'm asking for any suggestions.

I've been stduying for online mcs program for one semester, and I've applied for at least 200 internship applicants for 2024 from 2023/7 to now. However, I only received one interview invite from Tesla for 2024 spring co-op, and other results are all rejections and several onlince assesments without positive results. 

I recently received the 2024 spring on-campus mcs program, and I'm thinking about whether I should go back to school as a full-time student or just keep doing the online mcs program and actively seeking for any possible internship opportunities.

&#x200B;

Pros:

1.connections with classmates and professors

2.life experience

3.more possible courses to take

Cons:

1.60K for total cost(living + tuition) studying for one year (on the other hand,16K for the online program to finish other 6 courses)

It's not a small amount for my condition, I need to pay my parents back in the future.

2.limited working time(This is actually my ***greatest concern***; I can only do internship for 2024 summer and try to find internship/full time after graduate at 2024/12) To be more specific, if I was lucky enough to get admitted for 2023 fall UIUC mcs on-campus program and I chose to go to campus, I will lose the only interview I got from Tesla because it's an on-site internship in north California.

14,1700698672.0,Job Prospects,"Hi, 
I was recently admitted for the 2024 spring semester. I was really looking forward for the admission decision. However, I started to do some research and arrived at the discussion of MSCS VS. MCS —specifically when it comes to job prospects and how hiring managers interpret each degree: I read that sometimes hiring managers tend to overlook professionals with MCS on their resume (as these programs seem to be more lenient when it comes to acceptance rate). 


I was actually thinking about applying for some internships to gain further professional experience, however, reading some comments on reddit, I'm really scared that I will not be able to secure a position just because of my degree name —even though the MSCS and MCS are extremely similar


I would really appreciate if you could help me ease some of these —perhaps irrational— thoughts.

I also felt I wrote a very strong statement of purpose.

I thought it was interesting how earning the Master's in Computer Science could still open a door for a professional with specific career goals, even for a person who has already been working as a Professor of Mathematics.

You could get an internship, relax at home with old friends, and many other things. Or you could bike from New York City to San Francisco with the Illini 4000. For the last 16 years we have biked across the U.S. to raise money for cancer research and support services and to document the experiences of cancer patients and their families. During our 4000+ mile trek from coast to coast we visit New York, Champaign, Chicago, San Francisco, and other major cities as well as national parks like Yellowstone, the Grand Tetons, Crater Lake, and Mt. Rainier. While riding through and staying in all of these incredible places, you will also make life long friends with the 20 other riders who will accompany you on this journey.

It may sound like you need to have years of cycling experience to be able to do something like this but you actually don't need to have any at all! Some of our past riders didn't even know how to ride a bike when they were chosen for the team. If you are selected for the 2024 Bike America Team, we will give you all of the ride time and training you will need to make the cross-country trip.

If this sounds at all interesting to you, apply [here](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSddRMs2W04R4SGPCcdpH06g9-8U0GS0KDQA4TUJoT1qG4yk1A/viewform?usp=sf_link) to join the 2024 Bike America Team. **Application closes this Friday, September 15 at 11:59 PM.** Don't miss your chance to have the best summer of your life and do it for a good cause!

Hey fellow Redditors,

I hope you're all doing well! I recently received a deferred admission email from UIUC for their MCS program for Spring 2024. However, I have already finalized my decision to pursue an MS in Computer Science at NEU (Northeastern University) for Fall 2023.

I have completed all the necessary steps for NEU, including visa appointment scheduling, course registration, and other formalities. However, I'm feeling a bit uncertain about the deferred admission offer from UIUC. While UIUC is undoubtedly a prestigious institution, I believe NEU aligns better with my academic and career goals.

Given the circumstances, I wanted to reach out to this fantastic community and seek your valuable suggestions. Has anyone else been in a similar situation before? Should I consider deferring my NEU admission and pursuing UIUC instead? Or would it be wiser to stick with my initial choice?

I am particularly interested in hearing from those who have attended either UIUC or NEU for their CS programs. How was your experience? Did you feel it opened doors for you in the industry or research opportunities? Any insights on the curriculum, faculty, and overall program quality would be greatly appreciated.

Moreover, if anyone has experience with deferring admissions or navigating the complexities of visa appointments, I would love to hear your advice. I want to ensure that I make the best decision for my future, taking into account all factors.

Thank you in advance for your help and suggestions. Your insights will truly assist me in making this important decision. I'm excited about the next chapter of my academic journey and appreciate any guidance you can provide.

145,1683973174.0,Please help!,"I’m a final year CS student from India (no work ex, just few internships) who had originally applied for Fall 23 but got a deferred Spring 24 (inaugral intake) admit for UIUC on-campus MCS program. I am really confused about whether I should take it up or not and would really love your help!

Before the confirmation from UIUC came through (with Summer 24 CPT), I was all excited and confident to join UC Santa Cruz (UCSC) for MS in CSE. I’m considering the following factors :

1. Weather : I’m not a winter person at all. It makes me worry if I won’t be able to perform well during the two winters I’d face at UIUC (Spring-Fall-Spring) while the weather in California is fine.

2. TAships : It is crucial for me to secure some sort of funding during the masters since I’ll be taking loans. Since the TAships aren’t abundant for MCS students and even the intake has increased since Fall 22 from what I could gather - 600+ instead of old around 200, would any other on-campus jobs help like Course Assistants etc? At the same time, I’m almost guranteed a TAship at UCSC for most quarters.

3. Program Duration - Internships : The 1.5 year program seems kinda rushed? In the context that considering the already unstable market with hardly any people with internships, would the time be enough for me instead of the 2 years that I’d get at UCSC? Also the fact that it starts in Spring - would most programs be done for Summer 24 since hiring cycles generally start in Sept for Summer Internships?

4. Course Structure : The program at UCSC helps me to do a project with an advisor whereas UIUC MCS is just the coursework. From what I know in CS, your projects matter a lot for interviews in entry level Data Engineering/MLE roles.

Honestly the only thing holding me back is that UIUC has big brand value and is T5-10 program whereas UCSC is idk probably a T50-100 program. UCSC is like a cushion where I’d be at ease to get my things done whereas UIUC has quite a few variables but is doable if things fall in place. 

PS : I kinda deal with imposter syndrome a lot and feel most of the time I’m not really good at stuff lol. During my undergrad, I couldn’t land a good school even though I had good grades. Even for master’s, I wasn’t expecting to get in at UIUC, so just makes me worry if I’m passing on a great opportunity to attend UIUC?

I would love to hear from folks in the MCS program and perspectives from international students.

I have work experience in SQL, Alteryx, some Power BI, a ton of Excel (not really pertinent to CS or DS), and some R. I have also used R in undergrad for an economics research project and have kept up with it, using it briefly at work but also taking a Udemy course on it that is more stats and ML based. I am currently taking a Udemy course on Python, as well.

&#x200B;

My undergrad background was a BS in economics and math from a small liberal arts college in IL. I graduated with a 3.62 (messed around too much freshman year) and I have a full calc sequence, linear algebra, mathematical stats, and probability theory with most of those having A's but some B+'s in Calc 2 and 3 cuz the pandemic really screwed me for a bit. But I followed those up with A's in LA, Stats and Prob. I have an A in a python programming class I took but it's been a bit since I have used Python, so I have been taking Jose Portilla's Udemy class on it for some refreshing tips (and it's been fun!). 

&#x200B;

I got into an economics PhD program and spent a semester in it before realizing I don't actually care about research as much as I thought I did, and mastering out with a MA in economics that was more theory based than applied just didn't seem like a good use of my time. And then that's what led me to learning more about the less expensive CS and DS masters options out there.

&#x200B;

My question is: what do I need to do to strengthen my profile? I realize I am lacking a lot in terms of the programming prereqs, but I feel strongly about my math ability. I am familiar with Oakton Community College and saw that they provide Data Structures, OOP & Algorithms (strange they put Objects and Algorithms together instead of structures and algos but idk), and Computer Architecture (not sure if UIUC cares so much about this) classes. I figure that college credit classes would be more appealing than a MOOC, but that is another route I could go. 

&#x200B;

I also thought about taking the Oakton classes, taking the UIUC MOOC on Accelerated Fundamentals, and then taking their Data Structures exam. This may be my best bet, but what do you all think? Any advice or tips on what I can do to make my profile more appealing to UIUC? 

&#x200B;

Also, I have the option to learn C++, Python or Java at Oakton, should I do C++ or stick with Python since I am interested in their DS track? Also, is the accelerated fundamentals MOOC and Data Structures exam on C++? If so, maybe that would be a better focus for the classes, while I finish up the Udemy course on Python so I am familiar with 2 languages then (3 if you count R).

&#x200B;

Are there other community colleges or online classes people typically recommend? I usually only ever hear about Oakton or Foothill.

&#x200B;

Also, does anyone know about UIUC's iCAN cert? Maybe that would be better than the community college credit, but might take longer and cost more $$$? There might be other online certs out there at other schools people have had luck with or heard good things about.

&#x200B;

Sorry for the long post, I have just been looking at all this the past few weeks and am really excited but nervous because I know I have some work to do. I truly believe, after crunching some numbers, that the return on investment is absolutely worth it. I would have some education reimbursement help from work and they are supportive of this endeavor, however, I need to get into a program first haha.

191,1679805831.0,UIUC Online MCS vs UT Austin MSCSO,"I know this must have been a topic asked gazillion times, but somehow I wasn't able to pinpoint any past discussions that meet my situation. I applied to both UIUC Online MCS (Summer 2023) and UT Austing MSCSO (Fall 2023). I got accepted to UIUC MCS and am very excited about it. The UT result hasn't come in yet, and it might not until late April or early May. Now I'm wondering if I should start the UIUC MCS in May or wait for Texas.

I really like the UIUC program and I'm sure it's going to give me a lot of things throughout the course. I have no doubt either program is valuable to my personal/professional goals: breaking into tech as a SWE and also developping my own products/business. I am basically making this post to solicit your thoughts on why I should choose UIUC over UT. Here are my pros/cons. Would you give any inputs?

**Pros - UIUC MCS**

* Unique curriculum
   * it seems to be more geared towards Data Science and Cloud
   * Texas looks to be more rounded/traditional CS
* Interesting courses
   * I am interested in IoT, Cloud, Haskell, and tons of stat/ML ones
* Reputation
   * Illinois is one of the most prestigious ones in CS
* Platform
   * I know Coursera but I don't know about UT's platform

**Cons - UIUC MCS**

* Price
   * $22k for UIUC vs 10k for Texas
* No thesis option
   * I don't know if I will be qualified but I'm a bit interested in doing PhD
   * MCS, being a professional degree, seems unlikely to give me the career option. Will there be any 500-level courses where I can work on papers?
* Course variety
   * While it has some very unique courses, it does not offer Operating Systems/Algorithms
* Proctor
   * I heared UIUC's Proctor software is notorious but I don't know if that's not an issue with UT",OneTarHeel,5,1.0,13,https://www.reddit.com/r/UIUC_MCS/comments/122ba0b/uiuc_online_mcs_vs_ut_austin_mscso/

197,1679546024.0,newly admitted MSCS student looking for roommates!," Hi, every one! My name is Lisa Fang. I am a newly admitted student in master of science in computer science. I am looking for female roommates to share a cheap, quiet, and spacious 3b3b apartment with me. Email me through hanxif01@gmail.com or DM me and we could arrange a zoom meeting to check if we are fit.About the apartment：

1. location: Capstone Quarters, 1901 N Lincoln Ave, Urbana, IL. It is right next to a bus station. The buses run every ten minutes, and since it is the departure station, there's no need to worry about the seat availability. It only takes 8 minutes(walking time included) to arrive Thomas M. Siebel Center for Computer Science.
2. Although it is a 4b4b apartment, only three of the four rooms are used for renting while the other one is used as the house owner's storage room (so we can regard it as a 3b3b). The rent rate is 525 per person, with Wifi, parking, utilities included. (If the utilities fee exeeds 150 dollars/month, we should pay the exeeded parts ourselves) . The total area is 1,540 SF.
3. It is on top floor and thus is quite quiet.
4. The apartment is available now and you can move in at any time.
5. There is swimming pool and gym in the community. The community is very safe.
6. The only requirement by the owner is that renters should be drug free, never make loud noise after 10p.m. (because the owner's friend is living downstairs), no smoke and keep the basic cleaness.

About me: I never hold late night parties, and I am quite organized and clean. I love running, biking reading, watching films and hiking. I am very outgoing and wish to be friends with people from different countries! I am very clean and easy-going, usually sleep between 11p.m. to 8a.m. So I would prefer you to keep quiet during that time period and I would also keep quiet when you are asleep.

209,1677953189.0,GT OMSCS or UIUC MCS?,"\*I posted same message in OMSCS reddit too...just looking to get another opinion from UIUC students\*

I am looking for pro and cons and what program might be the best for myself.  I am in the middle of putting together my application for GT OMSCS and a friend recommended I look at UIUC MCS program too and it looks very interesting too.  I wanted to get other's thoughts on why they choose GT OMSCS over UIUC, or whether they just only applied to GT OMSCS since it was the more established/popular option?

**Background**

BS Mechanical Engineering - mid tier UC school, 3.7 gpa

MS Mechanical Engineering - top public, 3.5 gpa

MBA - top public, no grades : )

5 years working as an engineer in chemical/mechanical engineering field, and another 6 years working for FAANG company on product management on hardware products.

**Purpose**

I would like to just get the software credential so I can shift to product management in SaaS or cloud computing positions for start-ups or mid-sized companies.  There is lots of interesting stuff happening now with Machine Learning, AI, computer vision, robotics, and I see value in learning the theory to these technologies and how it can transfer to my career.

**GT OMSCS vs UIUC MCS**

I think I'll likely get admits to both programs (hopefully : )), and I will apply GT OMSCS and thinking about adding UIUC.  I view both schools to be academically equal, I've worked with alumni with graduates from both schools and they are solid.  I would describe both as a bit ""under the radar"" schools as they don't carry the same layman name recognizition as Stanford or MIT but people in the know, know they are solid engineering schools.

It seems GT OMSCS has a larger and more established community so that is a pro.  Lots of electives are also available so I can have my pick of what class to take (AI, ML, and HCI all seem interesting).  I am old enough where I do want to learn more about software (not just get the degree stamp) but I also do not really want to go through any academic ""hazing.""  My math is rusty but I think I can relearn the theory through review, although I am not nearly as quick in doing calculations as I was in my 20s.  I am a bit concerned that GT OMSCS lets in a lot of people but lots of people wash out due to time commitment and/or challenge.

UIUC seems a bit smaller (both pro and con) which means maybe it would be easier to get time for professors.  UIUC requires 8 classes, while GT requires 10 classes...so UIUC could potentially be a quicker path to a MS CS degree.  UIUC cost marginally more \~$20 vs \~$7k, but doesn't seem to be a big deal given you are doing this for 3 year, ie time investment is the big deal here.  I think UIUC online MS is same degree as in-person too but I couldn't really figure that out on their website.

Anyways I just wanted to hear pros and cons of attending both programs.  I was completely on board with GT OMSCS a few weeks ago but all this talk about difficulty of classes like graduate algorathms has me concerned about wash out rate and time commitment.  I do want to learn but definitely over the academic hazing.  It also seems UIUC is 2 classes shorter so getting out of program might be better for me (as I already have an engineering masters)....",nomsg7111,11,0.93,23,https://www.reddit.com/r/UIUC_MCS/comments/11i8lws/gt_omscs_or_uiuc_mcs/

211,1677823277.0,Pay Scale Variation with Location,"Hi,

I will begin my post with a background to my question. I apologize in advice for the lengthy post, and please pardon my English and unprofessional tone as English is my fourth language. If this background is too long for you, you may skip to the later part of this post where I address my main question.

I am currently pursuing a master's from a BIG10 in cs. I have been in the field as a student and throughout my years I have met many people in the field. One thing that astonishes me is the pay scale variation and its relation to location. To elaborate, I know many people - from my undergrad (another BIG10) - that chose to join the workforce after their 4 yrs of undergrad. Their starting salaries were well above 150k TC. Some of my friends were also proud to announce their salaries reaching close to the 200k TC mark. They are all in SDE/SWE positions located in prime tech hubs in the United States such as the Bay area, Seattle, and Texas. Fast forward 2 years, my friends that once boasted about their generous pay scales informed me, and may others in my friend group, about their recent promotion and respective pay scale increase to well above the 200k TC mark. To add more fuel to this, Amazon recently announced an increase in SDE/SWE salary to around 300k TC. My main conundrum stems from my interaction with my classmates from my master's program. Many of my classmates at my master's program come from Asia, more specifically south east Asia. They chose to pursue a masters with the hope to gain an employment in the United States in tech primarily due to its financial benefit. Most of my master's colleagues spent time in SDE/SWE positions in their native country where they revealed to me that their pay was around the 40k TC mark (converted from their native currency to USD). Their work, as described to me, is identical to the work done by my friends from my undergrad. Moreover, the corporations in the US that my undergrad friends work for are the same ones that my master's classmates worked for in their native country. In a sense, my master's classmates' work in their native country seemed to be the same work, with the same job title, as that of my undergrad friends with the added fact that my master's classmates working conditions were not as relaxed as my undergrad friends' working conditions, and my master's classmates essentially made just twenty percent in TC of my undergrad friends.

**QUESTION 1:** My question is, do SDE/SWE positions in the United States prime tech hubs genuinely pay five times of the SDE/SWE positions in other parts of the world? If so, why have these tech companies not taken advantage of the free market and moved their SDE/SWE branches overseas? What is keeping these tech companies from doing so?

I understand the economics of an identical job in separate countries having separate wages. Nevertheless, I do not understand why these jobs would remain in the US given that the corporation is a profit maximizing corporation and it would be in its best interest to relocate the SDE/SWE position overseas.

Many may point to the notion that the job requires physical interaction which would mean that the employees would need to be physically present in the office in the US. To this point of view, I would like to mention that most of my undergraduate friends work completely remotely. Even my undergraduate friends who are physically present in the office, are there from personal choice and often work from home without any repercussion. Not to mention that when Amazon wished to incorporate a more office centric SDE/SWE position, it received massive resistance from people who are in the SDE/SWE positions and have since prompted Amazon to keep the status quo. Clearly, the SDE/SWE position can be done completely remotely!

**QUESTION 2:** Will this trend of paying SDE/SWE positions packages comparable to a doctor's salary be sustainable long term in the United States?

I ask this question because of the recent massive layoffs in tech. I am worried about my future and I am confused about reality. As I have not personally yet worked in one of these positions in the US, due to visa issues, I have not been exposed the reality myself. In one hand I wish to be in tech, mainly due to its financial benefit coupled with its relaxed lifestyle as compared to may of the other jobs at this pay scale, but on the other hand I am genuinely not as passionate about tech as my peers and only want to reap the financial benefits. If the account from my undergraduate friends are inspired by mischievous yet not ill-intended boastful nature of theirs, I wish to transition to another field that excites me beyond the financial benefits.

As a closing remark, I would like tho thank those who have taken time out of their lives to read my post and address my concerns in this matter! I know that in this hyper-competitive world, people may not have the time to engage in a post of this manner. As always, any and all view points/personal accounts/opinions are welcome and encouraged.

Best,

Both companies are willing to verify my employment and provided contact numbers. UIUC requires direct letters from employers to qualify for language exam waiver. 

I am applying for the Online Masters in Computer Science program at UIUC Summer 2023 term and I'm a Canadian resident. Based on the language exam waiver from UIUC:
> ENGLISH PROFICIENCY REQUIREMENT EXEMPTIONS
Applicants who meet one of the following criteria are exempt from the English proficiency requirement for admission:

> - Received a post-secondary degree from a U.S. institution (or an institution within an approved country) within five years of the proposed admission term.
> - Completion of at least two years of post-secondary study in the U.S. (or an approved country) within five years of the proposed term of initial enrollment.
> - Completion of at least two years of professional work experience in the U.S. (or an approved country) within five years of the proposed term of initial enrollment.

My situation is tricky. I received my undergraduate diploma in May 2018 in Canada (approved country). It has been more than 5 year so I'm disqualified for #1 or #2. I worked in two companies since Jun 2018 until today in Canada. So I'm qualified for #3. Both companies can provide letters of employment verification, but only to me. Both refuse to send the letter directly to UIUC for security reason. 

However, UIUC strictly mentions that 
> Eligible applicants will be required to submit supporting documentation, sent to the department **directly by their employer(s)**. Documentation indicating the period(s) of employment and location must be sent directly to online-mcs@cs.illinois.edu.

Hi!

I am working on the OMSA degree and was interested in getting a more robust CS background to become a more advanced Data Scientist / ML Engineer.

Would completing coursework in OMSA and then applying for UIUC program help me accomplish the above?

From what I understand, OMSA gives exposure to CS principles but isn’t a CS degree. ML Engineers and DS professionals need a robust CS background to make modeling/recommendation engines deployable to production.

Is this a waste of time? Should I look at just transferring/pivoting to UIUC MCS instead of finishing out OMSA? 

Would 2 Masters degrees begin to start presenting negatively on my resume i.e. “this guy is just a degree/credential chaser vs. actually using the degree”

3. I've gone to 3 colleges. 1 was for a short time where I was just taking language classes for fun. The second was as a visiting student at a top school. Should I include those?
4. How good is the MCS program? Is there any loss taking it compared to the MS CS if my goal is to work in industry?

I heard that we get  a list of courses to opt from after admission, but how wide is this range of courses? What level courses are they typically?

Also, is it generally doable to combine TAing and taking 10-12 credits in CS in one semester + finding a job?

My GPA is around 3.5 right now, but I am afraid I won't be able to keep this up and eventually get kicked out of the program OR won't be able to find a job, meaning my VISA will expire :S I would not consider myself very smart lol.

Also, I barely have professional CS experience (besides 1 internship and a small backend SWE job), which lowers my chances to get selected as TA I am afraid... + it makes me doubt whether I will be able to get into a job before I graduate...

I have neither CS / DS academic nor work experience and looking to take a few courses as recommended by UIUC (below list) before I proceed any further.

I would really like recommendations from users for Distance/Online CS certifications OR anyone that could recommend where I can take these courses on an online format, for actual uni/college credits. Unfortunately UIUC does not offer these classes online so I have been randomly searching.

(2) Discrete Structures
(3) Data Structures
(4) Applied Linear Algebra
(5) Probability and Statistics for CS

Hi all, I held 2 Bachelor degrees in Stats and Econ, but with an overall gpa of 2.84 (got burnout by pursuing 2 degrees during undergrad, I should focus on one degree instead). I have about 3-years exp in 2 faang companies as a data analyst contractor. I want to advance my career and apply to this program. I know the admission is strict about gpa, so I spent half year to strengthen my application by doing the following to offset my low gpa:

1.Took prerequisite courses in local community college and aced all of them, including oop, data structure, linear algebra. (The application separately asked for letter grades for Data Structure course and Algorithm course each, but the course I took in CC was called “Data Structure” and covered both topics in data structure and algo analysis. I just fill-in the boxes with the same course, not sure if that will cause problems)

2.Passed the ds&a proficiency exam with an A

3.Had 3 strong LoR, 2 from cs professors and 1 from math professor. They are all from my prerequisite courses.

4.Had a strong SoP edited by an expert, I talked about how my work exp and edu background can fit into the program and I will be benefited from the program, and slightly mentioned why my gpa was low… 

I believe there’s nothing more I can do at this point. If I still get rejected, I might need to pursue a cs certificate or post-bacc in order to show I’m capable of handling graduate level courses.

I just submitted my application yesterday. I also applied to multiple online cs master programs too, but still feel anxious upon waiting for the results.

353,1650801726.0,UIUC MCS or Stony Brook MSCS?," 

I  have received two admits for Fall 2022, one from University of Illinois  Urbana-Champaign for on-campus Professional Master of Computer Science  (MCS) and another from Stony Brook for Computer Science MS. If I am  thinking of going for a job after getting my Masters degree, which  University would be a better choice?

What I know so far :

Stony Brook (MSCS):

\-> Relatively Less Tuition Cost.

\->  Close to New York.( Another small factor is that I am a Vegetarian and  from India, so the location will also be more advantageous in terms of  weather and getting food supplies).

\->  Opportunities for RA/TA.  -> Incase I get interested in  research/PhD, doing an MSCS will be more advantageous. ( Although I can  always try pursue PhD after a few years of job experience, in case I  choose UIUC).

\-> Choice to go for 1.5 or 2years for completion.

UIUC(MCS):

\-> I like the curriculum a little better ( I am interested in Artificial Intelligence/ Machine Learning.)

\-> Highly ranked University with a huge brand name.

\-> Located in a town, might cause problems with getting supplies.

\-> Weather might be too cold.

\-> Very high tuition fee.

\-> No/Minimal chance of TA/RA.

I  have heard some people say that students from both Universities get  jobs in top companies but I have also heard that being a student from  UIUC gives an advantage in getting jobs, especially ones with high  packages. Obviously my main goal is to study and I want to learn from  the best, but the cost is also high and I will be taking a loan, so I  need to know the internships/jobs scenario.

I  would like to know what everyone else's opinion is on this as it would  help me get a better picture and make an informed decision.

I am an incoming student in the Fall of 2022 at UIUC. The class registration process is yet to begin, but I would appreciate some advice about what classes should I surely register for. Basically, the classes that are exceptional but don't have a massive course load as I have been advised to keep the burden a little light in the first semester and focus on getting an internship. Or maybe suggest some classes that you guys took and were just too good to pass up. 

Some classes that I have been recommended are:

\-Artificial Intelligence (440)

\-Computer Vision (for things like Kinect/Move/Wii programming) (543)

\-Parallel Programming (436)

\-Software Engineering I, II, Advanced Topics (427, 428, 527)

\-Object-Oriented Programming (528)

\-Machine Learning (446)

I have been in the bioinformatics field for about 4 years after taking some graduate courses at JHU and then dropping out because of the cost. For that program, I had to take data structures and intro to java (OOP), both of which are prereqs for this program. I have also been, like I mentioned, coding in R and Python (mostly R) for years in the field now. 

I want to go back to school, this time for DS, and generalize my knowledge and skill set. How would you recommend that I approach fulfilling the prereqs? I read somewhere else that I should take the [accelerated foundations coursera course](https://www.reddit.com/r/UIUC_MCS/comments/jrk6ec/comment/gbw5lgq/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=web2x&context=3) and then take the proficiency exam. I have an extremely difficult time doing self-driven courses but I could will myself to do it for this program, plus, I think it would be good knowledge anyway.

Another idea I had, and this is because I already have some of the prereqs, is to just find a nearby community college/state school and take the courses a la carte there. Is this advisable? Has anyone else had experience with this? If so, I may be able to knock them out this summer and fall.

I have taken an intro C++ course and discrete math in Fall 2021 both of which I got A’s in. My local community college has a small CS dept and I realized that the Professor isn’t the best (I would agree since I took him for discrete math and had to learn everything on my own). There is a part 2 to the C++ programming class that I am signed up for this Spring however the DS&A class that comes right after is only offered in the Spring semester. I spoke to the professor about it and he said I could learn the material for C++ 2 class and if I did well I can take the DS&A course. Although I have been learning the material for C++ 2 and it makes sense, I get this feeling that I should just wait to take the DS&A over the summer at another CC near me (they have better teachers too). What should I do? 

I have heard far and wide that DS&A is the most important course in CS and I want to ensure that I learn it correctly as opposed to piecing things together as I go along at my CC. 

I was also wondering the following: I was originally planning on applying for Fall 2022. Assuming that I take the DS&A course and I am registered for it by the summer application, do you think I have a shot of getting accepted? Obviously IK it would be dependent on me passing the course and everything but still.

If I'm accepted, I will quit the old program and will enroll in the MCS program. I am registered for an online section of CS 498 Game Development, 4 credit hours, for Spring 2022. It does count toward my current masters requirements but I'm wondering if it will count toward the MCS if I try to transfer the credits later. I mean, it is a 4 credit CS class with UIUC, but it's not one of the classes in the online MCS curriculum, so will I have a problem? I may just register for one of the online MCS classes when they open the sections up to non-MCS grad students but I'd love to take Game Development if it will transfer.

EDIT: Well I got a reply and this is all they said:

“Up to 12 credit hours of previous graduate coursework that is approved by the Department of Computer Science (including non-degree graduate courses completed within the Department of Computer Science) may be transferred and applied to the Professional MCS degree requirements. Credit hours used to confer a previous degree are not transferable.”

I’m assuming it will count as long as I fulfill the requirements of three 500 level classes and a class from each of the 4 areas.

422,1640583951.0,"For 1st semester, CS441 AML vs CS412 Intro to DM?","Hi, everyone.  
Thankfully I join online MCS-DS track as 2022 Spring cohort, so this will be my first semester.  
I am planning to attend only 1 course at every semester because I have a job in my daytime.  
So I feel like I have to choose course very carefully to graduate within 8 semesters.  
In this circumstances, my first challenge is selecting between CS441 AML and CS412 Intro to DM.  
Would you read my worry and give me some advice?  


**CS441 AML**  
Pros.  
I think attending ML class is necessary to be a data scientist, and it's the only ML class in MCS-DS.  
If there is no other choice, why not choose this as my first class?  
Moreover, AML is usually availabe at Fall semester and there is a lot of other available courses at Fall.  
So, if I finish it in Spring, I think it might be good for course balancing later.  
(I want to graduate as fast as possible)  
Cons.  
I saw a lot of course reviews that AML needs to be revamped.  
Do you think CS441 AML will be revamped in better way sooner or later?  
If it might be revamped later, should I attend it at 1st semester?  


**CS412 Intro to Data Mining**  
To me, CS598 Data Mining Capstone course seems attractive. I saw a lot of course review that it's not worthy, but I want to have an opportunity to read latest thesis of data science and develop my own portfolio.  
(And honestly, doesn't the course name ""Data Mining Capstone"" look good if it's in CV when searching data mining job?)  
So I was planning to attend CS412 Intro to DM(and CS410 TIS) as a prerequisite to CS598 DM capstone.  
However, I saw an notice like:  
\++Please note that the capstone courses are being phased out effective Summer 2021. Future offerings of capstone courses are not expected.  
If DM capstone course might not be offered later, I think there is no reason that I should attend this class.  


**Conclusion.**  
Because AML seems almost necessary and DM capstone might be disappeared soon, I feel slightly more inclined to attend CS441 AML.

  
Do you have any opinion or advice?  
Will CS412 Intro to DM be better than CS441 AML?

429,1639012855.0,Spring 2022 - CS 484 vs CS 441 thoughts?,"This is my first semester and I am considering CS 484 or CS 441

I am considering CS 484 because I think it's an interesting course but the reviews made me think if I have what it takes to learn because I only have more exposure to C in undergrad and I took multiple courses in C up until data structures & Algorithm for computer engineering students (managed to complete Huffman algorithm flawlessly). I only took one C++ course during my Junior year. Do you think this exposure in C is sufficient for CS 484?

I am considering CS 441 as well because it's applied ML and I think it would be useful for me down the road for software engineering. However, I am not doing DS track so I'm being particular about DS-related courses. I heard CS 441 is being improved significantly as well this year.

I've read through multiple admissions threads which made me confused given the fact that people have experiences in conflict with what the admissions team has stated are their prerequisites.

First, how important is it for a candidate to have completed the linear algebra requirement, have there been many people admitted who did not take linear algebra? I've completed every other prerequisite for the program with an A but I do not have the time to take linear algebra prior to my application deadline and it is also not an offered course at community colleges in my city which has made it difficult to take.

Also, I am confused about the OOP and DS&A requirements. Are these requirements fulfilled by the typical first year of computer science courses, such as a semester of Introduction to Computer Science and a semester of Data Structures & Algorithms? What is confusing is that it seems people have taken these two courses and every other prerequisite, received high grades in all of them, and yet they've still received conditional admission with messages claiming they've not met the prerequisites for the program. They are then asked to take the proficiency exam in order to qualify for admission. Why is this?

What is the consensus on the difficulty of the exam, is it something that is extremely difficult even if someone has done well in the prerequisites? How long does it take to prepare for?

Lastly, on a less related note, does anyone know what level of support online students get for this program? Do they get the general office hours and student resources that on campus programs provide or is it more of a throw everyone to the wolves situation, which I hear Georgia Tech's online program is guilty of?

I am a first-semester student in the online MCS-DS program, and I'm currently enrolled in CS441 Applied Machine Learning. The content itself has been interesting but I am incredibly frustrated with the teaching. Without going into too much detail, the lectures are very lacking and I'm finding it to be a battle to learn the information I need. Once I parse out what I need to know, it's pretty straightforward to understand, but I feel like I have to trudge through a lot of poorly made content to make that happen. I'm also just having trouble adjusting to being in school again after 2 years of working full time, so I'm definitely behind in the class and not getting much out of the experience. I'm also enrolled in CS 410 and that's going great, so it's really just this particular class I'm frustrated with. 

I'm thinking of dropping 441 in favor of taking CS 598 Deep Learning for Healthcare next semester. I would plan to use the free MOOC version of 441 to pad my understanding of machine learning for CS 598 in preparation for next semester.

Based on this [DROPPING-A-CLASS](https://online.illinois.edu/getting-started/dropping-a-class) I see that there are 3 options - 

* **CANCELLATION** : A cancellation occurs when a student disenrolls all course sections for a term prior to classes beginning.
* **DROP** : To drop is to disenroll from one or more courses while remaining enrolled in at least one course.
* **WITHDRAW** : To withdraw is to disenroll from all course sections on or after the first day of instruction.

Since graduating, I have worked as an actuarial analyst for a little over year and I am now working as a senior analytics consultant at a major healthcare company. 

Based on what I have read here, I need to have a solid foundation in CS courses. I am planning on taking a C++ class with discrete math this fall and finishing it up with data structures and an algorithms class. I have stats/probability as well as linear algebra courses from my bachelors. I am also planning on completing the Accelerated Computer Science fundamentals track on Coursera. I am also taking Datacamp Python and R courses to learn those skills/languages as well.

494,1626624539.0,I'm a recent biology grad w/ a minor in CS. Is this program for me or should I look for others?,"Hi everyone! To give you some background, I'm a recent biology grad from the Bay Area who took most of the major CS lower division courses (OOP, DS&A, discrete math, linear algebra, calculus). I honestly thought about switching majors to CS halfway through college but I was pretty set on medical school back then.

Anyways, I've decided I want to work in tech but I'm not so sure how I should plan out my journey since I'm a year out from school and my programming/CS skills are a bit rusty. However, it seems like getting a masters in CS would make my life much easier in terms of getting past recruiter screens. I'm not sure if a bootcamp would be worth it for me since I feel like I already have a somewhat solid foundation. **My main goal is to try to break into the industry in the least amount of time possible while still getting a strong foundation in CS and software engineering.**

I've already been accepted to OMSCS for the fall but I am thinking of applying to some others that are on-campus as well as the online masters program at UIUC.

My main concern is whether OMSCS or UIUC is the best fit for me in terms of helping me pivot my career into tech. I'm not sure if I am putting myself at disadvantage by not applying to others masters programs considering that they might possibly land me better opportunities but will probably be more expensive ($50k-80k). If I enroll in UIUC in the Spring, I would also finish it much faster than if I enrolled in OMSCS.

I also hate to say it, but it I scared recruiters will think that look down at the MCS from UIUC and will disregard my application. UIUC also seems like its more geared towards data science from looking at the coursework compared to OMSCS which has more classes geared towards software engineering. If anyone else was in a similar situation as me, I would love to hear what you decided to do and if it worked out for you or not.

Here are the different options I have:

1. Attend OMSCS part-time or UIUC full-time and try to get an internship that will hopefully turn into a full-time offer. **If I enroll in UIUC, I will probably graduate earlier than if I were in OMSCS.**
2. Attend an on-campus masters full-time in Fall 2022 and also try to get an internship that could possibly turn into a FT offer. **I would have to essentially wait a year to start grad school if I choose this option.**
3. Don't attend any masters program and try to leverage my CS minor along with side projects to get a job (most difficult option, lol)

**TLDR: Should I teach myself the skills necessary to get a job as a SWE or would it be better use of my time to enroll in UIUC or OMSCS and get an internship that will hopefully lead me to a FT offer?**",iamthat1dude,5,0.78,5,https://www.reddit.com/r/UIUC_MCS/comments/omth8t/im_a_recent_biology_grad_w_a_minor_in_cs_is_this/

499,1626361592.0,"The answer to: ""What is the chance I will be accepted into the UIUC MCS / MCS-DS program?""","Short answer:
**No one knows if you will be accepted, therefore you should just apply**.

Long answer:
The only reason to look for an accurate measure of your acceptance chance is to potentially save the time required to fill out the application and the $70 application fee by not applying.  $70 probably makes little difference to most potential applicants, given that they are considering a commitment to pay more than $21,000 in future tuition.  The time to fill out the application is short given how many other applications you will be completing concurrently.

The ""requirements"" are not set in stone.  People who meet all the ""requirements"" and more have been denied (FANG jobs for years, high scores in CS, etc.), and people have been accepted who do not meet all of them.

As of today, 7/15/21, the ""requirements"" listed on the [MCS/MCS-DS website](https://cs.illinois.edu/academics/graduate/professional-mcs/online-master-computer-science-data-science#ApplicationInfo) are:

 * Applicants should hold a 4-year bachelor's degree (or equivalent).
 * Applicants with a bachelor’s degree in a field other than CS are encouraged to apply
 * Applicants can strengthen their application by passing the optional Data Structures Proficiency Exam.
 * The recommended undergraduate GPA ... is 3.2/4.0 or higher. 
 * GRE not required (as of now)
 * Applications do not require letters of recommendation


Incidentally, this is fairly common for most education programs in the US.  Virtually no one is guaranteed to be accepted to any college or graduate school in the US (barring conditional offers of admission, special circumstances, very low competitiveness).  You may be accepted to Harvard and denied at Florida State (absolutely nothing against Florida State, it's just less competitive in admissions).  This is more common than one might think, because admissions are governed by complex calculations with location and demographic considerations among others that are not under one's control.

Bottom line:
There isn't much use in belaboring your potential chances, just apply to a lot of programs and choose the best one for you once all the responses arrive.",djoldman,8,0.83,7,https://www.reddit.com/r/UIUC_MCS/comments/okupnp/the_answer_to_what_is_the_chance_i_will_be/
